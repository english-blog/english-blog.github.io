      Show image as background to text. You can't really calculate the width
      reliably in JS because margins are not taken into account by any of
      clientWidth, offsetWidth or scrollWidth, so we don't force a minimum
      width if the user is using shrink to fit.
      This results in a margin-width's worth of pixels being cropped. If the
      user is not using shrink to fit then we expand the header.

&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.stevechandler.com/index.html" target="_blank"&gt;Steve Chandler&lt;/a&gt; is one of the most sought after personal development guru in America and the best selling author of over 30 books. This audio book in his own voice is more than a decade old, but still holds good to this world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Everybody needs motivation to achieve their goals. As humans, we cannot be high on motivation all the time. We do reach stressful low situations sometimes and we do certain things to bounce back. Everybody has their own ways to keep the motivation level high. Steve tells you 100 different ways to keep motivate yourself in this audio book. Many of them are different, offer a different perspective and alters the way I think. I did compile a list of my favourite items from this 100 in a notepad. I will frequent this notepad again and again to keep me motivated towards my goals. Thank you Steve for this collection.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Some of my favorites are: (just a gist - listen to him for detailed explanation)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. &lt;b&gt;Kill Your Television&lt;/b&gt; - One side of the glass is the people who do and on the other side, the people who watch. Which side you belong to?. Never thought in this perspective.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;2. &lt;b&gt;Leave Your Friends&lt;/b&gt; - who does not support your goals or share your vision. This one would be tough. I have a lot of friends who are really good at heart, but ridicule/laugh at my every goal, idea or vision. Eventually I stopped sharing my ideas with them. Steve suggests to do that early. There are billions of other people who can help you propel ahead.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
3.&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;Run Towards Your Fears -&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;Something safe and better wait on the other side of your fear.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
4. &lt;b&gt;Read Yourself a Success Story&lt;/b&gt; - Yes. Read Aloud. I learnt this technique in a voice acting course by Dr Prakash. It has helped me immensely. Pick up a book of success stories and read aloud to yourself a success story everyday. This works.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
5. &lt;b&gt;Just be Unexpected&lt;/b&gt; - Do what makes you tick. Write, Collaborate, Create. Do anything you want. Creativity does not mean originality. Build upon other's work, create a better version of it or simply share other's work, if you don't have a clue about creativity. Don't let the "&lt;i&gt;Originality&lt;/i&gt;" idea prevent you from doing something good.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
6. &lt;b&gt;Act Like a Hero&lt;/b&gt; - Damn. I do this from my childhood. Whenever I go to a movie and impressed with the hero, I think myself as the hero in the movie. I feel awesome. Without heroes, we are plain simple boring people. Choose as many heroes as you want, and try to act like one (doesn't mean to jump like spiderman)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
7. &lt;b&gt;Say NO to yourself&lt;/b&gt; - Seriously?. Yes. Sometimes. Especially when it comes to discipline. Your body and mind will come up with creative questions to keep you in the bed. Don't listen to them. Say NO. Become your own disciple. Do 2 things daily that you don't want to do. Assume that those are the orders from your guru version of yourself. Do it, no matter what you think.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
8. &lt;b&gt;Get up on the right side of the bed&lt;/b&gt; - Waking up with a high sense of purpose, motivates your brain to keep moving forward. Just wake up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
9. &lt;b&gt;Welcome Your Problems&lt;/b&gt; - Every solution has a problem in first place. So, welcome yours and strive to work towards the solution.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
10. &lt;b&gt;Drive to a Library&lt;/b&gt; - Trust me, this would be the best spent miles on your car. Drive to a library at regular intervals and pick up a book of your choice or get a book online.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
11. &lt;b&gt;Replace your Habits&lt;/b&gt; - Many of us have unhealthy or not-so-good habits, which we want to stop. Those habits cannot be killed instantly. They must be replaced with a new, healthy &amp;amp; positive one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
12. &lt;b&gt;Get some Coaching&lt;/b&gt; - I have been hearing this advice from almost all of the self help gurus out there. I never had a life coach in my life. But, beginning to think that I should have one. I am getting into intellectual conversations with few of my friends which helps me to clarify my thinking and made to make substantial changes in my life. If I could benefit from my friends, I would definitely benefit from a coach. I shall get one soon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
13. &lt;b&gt;Perform Rituals&lt;/b&gt; - My favorite lesson from Robin Sharma. After I started to wake up at 5 AM daily, I began my morning rituals and understand by practice, the importance of rituals. It does not matter how much time you spend on rituals. It could be 5 mins or 3 hrs (like me). What matters is that you do it consistently to see the benefits. You can see the rituals that I perform &lt;a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2013/08/48-days-challenge-wake-up-at-5-am-daily.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
14. &lt;b&gt;Keep All your Promises&lt;/b&gt; - No matter what happens, fulfill your promises. Think twice before making a promise and never back out from it, once it is made. The pride and self-confidence that you get out of fulfilling your promises against odd situations, is more valuable to your personal growth than anything else in this world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
15. &lt;b&gt;Be a List writer&lt;/b&gt; - Break them down to lists. Anything. Be it a problem, solution, suggestion, ideas, planing for a trip. Anything. Just list them down to small activities. Once you write them down in paper in the form of lists, the task at hand seems simple and do-able. Just do it.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The previous book that I read, &lt;a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2013/09/attract-money-now-audio-book-review.html"&gt;Attract Money Now&lt;/a&gt; lead me to this extra-ordinary book "Zero Limits". I must say that I am impressed with the "Ho'oponopono"concepts discussed in this book. This is something that I never heard of before. Ho'oponopono is an modern version of an ancient Hawaiian healing system. This modern version is called &lt;i&gt;Self I-Dentity through Ho'oponopono&lt;/i&gt; (SITH). I am still trying to grasp the idea even hours after reading this book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The co-author Ihaleakala Hew Len, worked as a psychiatrist in a highly secured ward dedicated for mentally ill criminals in Hawaii State Hospital. Every criminal is chained and placed in separate rooms. There was high level of violence between the criminals and the doctors. Many hospital staff and doctors called in sick - most of them never want to work in that section. However, Dr. Hew Len cured every one of the patients without ever seeing them !!!. Yes. He never met any patient in person. Hard to believe that right?. Yes. For me too. Dr. Hew Len explains that he used Ho'oponopono method to cure the patients.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What is Ho'oponopono method?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Before understanding Ho'oponopono method, you must be clear with two things. &lt;i&gt;Responsibility &amp;amp; Reality.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Responsibility &lt;/b&gt;- How would you define it?. You are responsible for what you think, say and do. You take complete ownership of the situations &amp;amp; problems you get into because of your actions. Also, you take pride in achieving your goals due to your persistent actions. Perfect. That's how I would also define responsibility. Are you responsible for your colleague losing her job due to layoff?. Are you responsible for the Sep 11 tragedy?. Are you responsible for the war &amp;amp; killings in Iraq?. Will you be responsible for the War on Syria that Obama is planning?. The answer would be NO. But, Dr. Hew Len says "Yes".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Reality&lt;/b&gt; - Dr. Hew Len says, "What you see outside (the real world) is nothing but the projection of your inside". When you take 100% responsibility, you are responsible for every single experience that happens in your life. You are collectively responsible for the killing in war zone or the rape of a child in the remote corner of the world. When you hear, see or experience something in your life, be it good or bad - you are co-creating the reality with the others, even though you did not consciously contribute to that specific event or experience. A part of your mind is responsible for that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Imagine this, you walk in the "Las Vegas Strip", enjoying the casinos and having fun with your friends. Suddenly, out of nowhere an insane homeless guy shouts at you and even tries to attack you - you too are responsible for that event. A part of you was not right and it was in sync with the part of the homeless guy - thus creating an experience for both of you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ho'oponopono Method: &lt;/b&gt;This method is based on love and forgiveness. When something happens to you and it does not feel right for you, you can clean that part of you with love and forgiveness. When the cleansing is complete the experience reverses. You will be surrounded by peace. It is done by simply saying these four sentences in your mind or out loud, when you rehearse the experience in your mind or when that event is happening.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I Love You.&lt;br /&gt;
I am Sorry.&lt;br /&gt;
Please Forgive Me.&lt;br /&gt;
Thank You.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That's it?. Yes. That's it. It is so simple but very powerful. This is the same process used by Dr. Hew Len to cure a ward of criminally insane people, without even seeing them. He will read the report about the patient and use this process to clean the part of him, which in turn cured the patient. You can apply this technique to anything and everything in your life. If you read about a sad event or tragedy happened on the other side of the world, you are responsible too. So, clean it. You can apply this method to yourself, your problems, physical pain, diseases or anything that does not seem normal and happy. There is no limit. This method is about freedom, complete freedom from the past experiences and going to the Zero State of being nothing with no experience at all. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is filled with a whole bunch of stories and experiences of the those who practice Ho'oponopono. There are discussions about memory, inspiration, conscious mind, subconscious mind, super conscious mind ,divinity etc. As usual with Dr. Joe's hypnotic writing, you will read the book faster than you think you can. I'm serious. Read it to believe it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I already started using Ho'oponopono method and felt peace in mind, the very first day. I am planning to combine Ho'oponopono with &lt;a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2011/09/eft-manual-book-review.html"&gt;EFT&lt;/a&gt; and add it to my morning rituals. Let's see how it transforms my life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To learn more about the Ho'oponopono method, I suggest to look for the workshop conducted by Dr. Hew Len in Hawaii, US, Europe etc. Check the reference at the end of this blog. Another item to my Bucket List - &lt;i&gt;Attend Ho'oponopono workshop in Hawaii with Dr. Hew Len.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you Dr. Ihaleakala Hew Len for the Ho'oponopono method and Thank you Dr. Joe Vitale for bringing this as a book to the world.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JdXle7CW8vQ/Uke6Vd1iulI/AAAAAAAAV-M/5fJDw6QpYXA/s1600/blueprint-for-life-smileprem-premkumar-masilamani.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-JdXle7CW8vQ/Uke6Vd1iulI/AAAAAAAAV-M/5fJDw6QpYXA/s400/blueprint-for-life-smileprem-premkumar-masilamani.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What is a Blueprint for Life?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; It is the set of values that we live by. It is a set of rights/wrongs that we should/shouldn't do in our lives. Whether you know it or not, like it or not, everybody has a blueprint. I can simplify the term Blueprint with the term "Preference". Some people prefer to wake up early and some prefer to cuddle with bed till noon, Some prefer not to lie at any cost and some simply doesn't bother, Some doesn't drink alcohol and some drinks a lot, some prefers monogamy and some prefers polygamy. The list goes on and on, from very simple practice to the very complex situations in your life. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your habits, blueprints, preferences, thought patterns - all means the same. Your reaction to most of the situations in your life, can be predicted if your blueprint is known. You may say that you choose everything with your free will, rather than with the conditioned thought patterns. Consider this - if you never woke up before noon on any day and I ask you to wake up at 5 AM from tomorrow onwards - How easily could you do that?. If it is tough for you, then this is on your blueprint.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For many people, the blueprint is set by the religion they adhere to or set by their parents in their early ages or set by the teachings of the Guru's they follow dearly. Few people knew what their blueprint is, consciously updating their blueprints as they gain new experiences in life. Rest of the human population is simply unaware that they have a blueprint.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Should I bother about my blueprint?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Not required, if you are extremely happy and excited with your life and everything around you. After all, that is the only purpose of your life. Just enjoy the ride!... In case, your happiness begins to fade, then you are off the track and you must to do something to get back on track. How?. Consciously evaluate and update your blueprint. Why?. Because, your blueprint affects every little decision that you will make in your life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;How to list your Blueprint?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
List down all the values, practices or rituals that you live by. If you have never thought about your own set of values, you may need a little help. Imagine or think about your one complete day, from the moment you wake up till you go back to sleep. Slowly think about every single event that happens in your day. Do you see a pattern?. Do you see yourself doing the same thing again and again?. Do you see yourself behaving to the similar situation in the same way or different way each time?. Write them down.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Imagine the happiest or the toughest situation in your life. Did you react in a way that you wanted to react or did you react against your will?. Did you stand for what you felt right or succumbed to the situation?. Do you have any goal?. Will you do anything to achieve that goal or only the things that you feel right?. Do you want to serve the people?. How do you react in your relationships?. You take some relationships for granted, like your mom &amp;amp; dad?. How are you when you are with friends and compare that you being with strangers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These are some of the questions which will help you to discover your blueprints. Feel free to add more relevant questions. You may not get to know all the values in your blueprint. But you will sure get the core values which defines you. That's more than enough.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;How to evaluate your Blueprint?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you have the list of values to live by - think through each of the values in the list. Think about when this value would have been added to your blueprint. Think about the situation that caused you to adhere to this value. You will be surprised that most of your core values were formed during your childhood, mostly from your parents and society.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many times, you may not be able to point out a specific situation that changed your blueprint. It could be a series of experiences that caused the change in you. That's fine. Evaluate that specific value for it's relevance to today. If you continue with this value, will you achieve your goals or will you continue to be happy?. Will this value be relevant in future?. What are the downside of continuing this value in your life?. Are ready for that?.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you completed the evaluation of that specific value in your blueprint, move on to the next value. When the evaluation of all the values complete, your life becomes crystal clear for you. You know what to do and what not to do. You precisely know how to react to a specific situation that is in conflict with your value system. Your life becomes easy.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Updating your blueprint&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; As long as you live, you will encounter new experiences, meet new people that will change your perception about your life, drastically. When you feel the urge to change from inside, Change!!!. Refine your blueprint. Live with the new one. Don't hold to your old beliefs/values. I would never suggest to resist all the changes. I suggest that when you change, change consciously.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Other's values in your blueprint&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There many be some values in your blueprint which are imposed by others. There may be some things that you always wanted to do, but prohibited by your religion, society, family, friends, relatives etc. Those are not your values. Check the relevance of that value in your current life. Will that help you to progress in your life?. Will that keep you happy?. If yes, adhere to it and thank to whoever imposed it on you. If not, refine that value with something new and thank yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;My Blueprint:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Below are some of the core values in my blueprint, just to give an idea of what your list might look like. I did not publish everything, though. Neither should you. There will be definitely be some values so intimate to you. Keep it with yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Never lie in any situation (If I must, I choose NOT to say anything - but never lie)&lt;br /&gt;
2. Never fear anyone or any situation (If I fear something, voluntarily face it - till the fear fades away) &lt;br /&gt;
3. Respect comes from within, never bother to respect everyone (this one formed during my adolescent years and I am trying to change it now)&lt;br /&gt;
4. Eat Healthy &amp;amp; Nutritious Food (When I first read about Raw Vegan Lifestyle during my 7th grade)&lt;br /&gt;
5. Avoid Junk foods &amp;amp; Carbonated Beverages (Formed after the previous value)&lt;br /&gt;
6. Exercise regularly (Inspired by actor Surya in the Movie "Kakka Kakka")&lt;br /&gt;
7. Wake up Early (Inspired by Robin Sharma's teachings) &lt;br /&gt;
8. Stop Drinking &amp;amp; Smoking (Promised my sister and adhered to it for 5 years - changed now to a social drinker)&lt;br /&gt;
....&lt;br /&gt;
....&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;Am I an Engineer?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
By academics, Yes. I have an engineering degree in computer science, from one of the prestigious college in Tamilnadu, India. Do I feel epic about being an engineer?. Or at least do I think that I am an engineer?. NO... A Big NO... Why?&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I knew &lt;a href="http://www.mrfire.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Dr. Joe Vitale&lt;/a&gt; from the movie, "&lt;a href="http://thesecret.tv/" target="_blank"&gt;The Secret&lt;/a&gt;". I use to follow his blogs for a while and lost touch in course of time. Way back in 2008, I had downloaded this book to read in future. This week was it. Its simply awesome. I wish I could have read this book much earlier in my life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have read many books which teaches the tips, tricks and possible means to earn more money or create additional income streams. Most of them were about setting up your own business. This book is different from such other books. This does not teach about business or getting a higher paying job. This book discusses nothing that is materialistic. It's all about our minds, they way we think about money and how to alter our thinking to our favour. This book does not say, "&lt;i&gt;Just sit and day dream - Money will flow to you&lt;/i&gt;". We still have to do the hard work. It just helps to keep our minds focussed on abundance, instead of scarcity - which will obviously help to achieve our goals.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One good thing about this book is that, it has "action steps" at the end of each chapter which will help you to recollect what you learnt in that chapter and also to reflect your current situation with respect to the topic discussed. Please follow them. Not just in your mind. Take a pen and a paper and do the exercises. Write them down. I found this enormously useful. When you start writing your thoughts, without stopping, you will be surprised to know the hidden side of yourself. I did.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here is the gist of the 7 Steps that were discussed in this book. There were bonus materials at the end of the book too. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Step 1: Alter How You Think&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Limiting Beliefs - Any belief that is in conflict with your conscious goals or hinder/prevent you from achieving your goals. If your goal is to make more money, you should have a positive attitude towards money. Some people do think, "&lt;i&gt;Rich people are greedy&lt;/i&gt;", "&lt;i&gt;Wealthy people make money with immoral acts&lt;/i&gt;" etc., Those are not true. So, the first step is to identify, if you have any such beliefs over money or even the mild variations of such belief. Once you identified those beliefs, bring them to the light, question on the validity of those beliefs - 99.99% they are not valid. Once you consciously reason your belief and if that belief is proven wrong, it's no longer a belief for you. You are free from limiting beliefs about money. You should have a positive approach/belief to have more money in your life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Step 2: Give Without Expectation&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "You must tithe 10% of your income to the churches" - he he eh.. I am kidding. This is not Christianity. But the concept of tithing is a very powerful one. The author says that "Money flows". You should give as much as you receive. When you give money to others, you are in the flow. Your mind is open to abundance and free to think about other possible ways to make more money.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Couple of things to note here. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1.) Give without expecting anything in return. Otherwise, it becomes a business.&lt;br /&gt;
2.) Give to the place or person where you received inspiration. Not to churches, unless you receive inspiration from church.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Every week or every month or even every day, look for the place or person where you received the maximum of inspiration and give your money. It does not matter, if it is $1 or $1M. Just give what you can and you will attract more inspiration - which in turn makes you achieve more.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Step 3: Prosperous Spending&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Spending to attract more money?. This is something that I never heard of. Joe Vitale does not talk about reckless spending and racking up the credit cards. When you have the money to buy and there is a desire to buy, go buy!. Never buy on credit. The author stresses the importance spending for ourselves. Lot of times, we get into relationships and always think about making others happy and forget about spending for us. Spend for yourself. Spend with joy. When there is happiness in spending, you are in the flow of money. This is similar to Step 2, just that you give to yourself. Money is as much about spending as receiving. This is Prosperous Spending.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Step 4: Ask for Help&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Asking for help is the fourth step to attracting money into your life. There is always someone out there who can help with your problems. Don't hesitate to ask for help. Just ask. Many people have resistance in asking for help, but would feel happy to help when asked. Isn't it?. This is the first level in asking for help. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The second level is to form a Mastermind Group of like-minded people with similar goals - who can support each other. Make sure that the group is small and meet regularly. Your group should be such that you can openly share your goals and get support from your group - no matter how ridiculous your goal is. This is the best idea of Nepolean Hill from the world famous book "&lt;i&gt;Think &amp;amp; Grow Rich&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Step 5: Nevillize Your Goals&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; When it comes to achieving your goals, you will have greater success if you make emotional connections in your mind, where you can feel, hear and experience what it will be like to actually have what you're striving for. This is the same visualization concept explained in the movie "The Secret". Imagining the end results, when working towards a goal actually increases the success rate of achieving that goal. Dr. Joe Vitale coined the word "&lt;i&gt;Nevillize&lt;/i&gt;" to explain this process.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You may want to test this concept. Joe suggests to have a reasonable money goal, say "&lt;i&gt;Attract $1000, $2000 or $5000 within the next 30 days&lt;/i&gt;", nevillize that goal and keep an open mind for opportunities that may bring money. When you spot an opportunity, act on it immediately. You would have achieved that goal within that time. I am going to try this exercise. I will blog the results after 30 days :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Step 6: Think Like an Entrepreneur&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; "&lt;i&gt;The best way to attract money is to think like an entrepreneur&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The reason you want more money is that you want freedom. Freedom to go anywhere, do anything, live as you please and enjoy your life to the fullest. By far, the fastest way to accelerate your income is to become an entrepreneur. What he means by this is - Look for opportunities disguised in problems and see if we could make a business out of it. With the explosion of internet to the nook and corner of the world, setting up a business is easier, faster and cheaper than ever before. Also, he suggests to set up multiple streams of income, no matter how small it is. Choose the opportunities that grow over time. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Step 7: Help Your Community &amp;amp; Your World&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; The seventh and final step in attracting more money is caring for your community and the world as a whole. This works hand in hand with giving - but it's not just about money. It's about sharing your time, knowledge and the lessons you have learned. So, constantly look for opportunities to give back to the society. Your success will inspire others achieve even more in their lives.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
As you grow, your dreams and desires will change - don't be afraid to jump on new opportunities that inspire you. This is one of the area, that I have tough times to adjust with. I hang on to too many things that I originally decided to do. I thought that was persistence. But, Dr. Joe Vitale says that we must be free to move on to new ideas that excites and inspires us. Never fear to let go of the old ideas. Let me try.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
More than this, there is huge list of personal development books listed at the end of this book. I was very excited and decided to read each and every one of them. I chose to read "Zero Limits" by Dr. Joe Vitale which talks about a mysterious Hawaiian healing method.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks Dr. Joe Vitale for this book. I will try the steps described in this book and see what happens !&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;18-Sep-2013&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;.&amp;nbsp;
It started like any another day in the recent past. Woke up at 5 AM, brushed my teeth, drank a liter of water and ready to start my morning rituals. Just then, I noticed my laptop was closed. With a heavy sigh I thought, "She stopped the torrent again, fhoooh". I was surprised to see a nicely folded red color paper, printed with the text "&lt;i&gt;Looking Gorgeous&lt;/i&gt;", inside my laptop. Inside the paper was the first clue "&lt;i&gt;Cupboards with empty bottles will quench your thirst&lt;/i&gt;". I realized that it was a treasure hunt by my wife, one clue will lead to another and I am sure going to get a treat. I was excited and also confused at the same time. I could not think of any special occasion. I tried hard for a while and proceeded with the treasure hunt.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Bq9DIwylffI/UjlD0aYoqkI/AAAAAAAAV9E/V4-XL9TCfRY/s1600/DSC09357.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Bq9DIwylffI/UjlD0aYoqkI/AAAAAAAAV9E/V4-XL9TCfRY/s400/DSC09357.JPG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I found the second clue in the kitchen cabinet, third near the washing machine, fourth inside the shoe rack, fifth inside the freezer, sixth in my bike in the parking lot. While running down to the parking lot, I thought "&lt;i&gt;When did she planned all these things?&lt;/i&gt;". I came home early last evening, had early dinner and watched the whole movie "Jeans" with her and went to bed. It was a very relaxed evening and I was with her all the time, till we slept. But entire treasure hunt is planned before 5 AM in the morning. She must have done this after I slept. Hmm... &lt;i&gt;How did she guess that I will open the laptop first?&lt;/i&gt; - I have no idea. May be she guessed it too. It worked !. I love you pondatti !!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The seventh clue was under the kitchen floor mat, eighth clue was with Sruti, sleeping in the second bedroom. I was reluctant to wake her up at that time. But, it was mentioned in the clue and I have to follow it. As soon as I tapped her shoulder, she smiled and gave me the next clue. I knew that she was the partner in crime. The ninth clue under the sofa cushion and the tenth clue was under my wife's pillow. She was asleep. I took the clue carefully without waking her up. The final clue says "&lt;i&gt;Bedroom Attics are not only for Ghosts. Trick or Treat?&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3Mi7sV3fwXw/UjkjksoD30I/AAAAAAAAV78/gIq7X2O0vC4/s1600/DSC09341.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3Mi7sV3fwXw/UjkjksoD30I/AAAAAAAAV78/gIq7X2O0vC4/s400/DSC09341.JPG" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You know what?. I did not know the meaning of the word "Attic". I did not know what to do. Google did not struck my mind. I woke up Sruti again and asked her. She explained and went back to bed. I saw a beautifully wrapped gift box with couple of envelopes in the bedrrom attic. &lt;i&gt;Yeahhhh... The hunt is over!.&lt;/i&gt; I was about to tear off the gift wrapping and I realized that I do not know the reason still. One of the envelope had another piece of paper which said "&lt;i&gt;Happy 500th Day of Wedding - I Love You&lt;/i&gt;". I was smiling, blushing &amp;amp; loving her more than ever. The memories of our dating period flashed in my mind. &lt;i&gt;I love you forever, Pondatti.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The first envelope had the below caption. Only Me &amp;amp; Sangavi know the story behind it. Funny... he he he... Inside was a lovely greeting card. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The other envelope has couple of other cards with few colored pieces of something. Each piece had a letter painted on it. On closer inspection, I found they were pista shells. I remember last night, Sruti eating a lot of pista and offering me as well. But painting each of the shell would have taken a lot of time. Sruti must have helped Sangavi. Thank you Sruti. :) Hmm... Now I have a tough decision to make. To open the gift or to solve the puzzle. Paused for a while and went on to solve the puzzle first.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eybrIYyj-fQ/UjlEiCPPZvI/AAAAAAAAV9M/o7jyAkjw5y0/s1600/DSC09358.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eybrIYyj-fQ/UjlEiCPPZvI/AAAAAAAAV9M/o7jyAkjw5y0/s640/DSC09358.JPG" width="384" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Each shell is coated with Red, Silver or Bronze color with an English alphabet on it. Both the sides of the shell were painted with different color and different alphabet. One clue says Concave and the other says Convex. I tried to recollect the physics formulae for focal length that I learned in school and later found myself that it denotes the shape of the pista shell. This one must be from Sruti. I know my wife's interest in physics :). Almost after 30 minutes, I solved both the puzzles. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Puzzle 1: &lt;i&gt;Your Heart is My Safe Heaven&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Puzzle 2: &lt;i&gt;500 Happy Days of Prem &amp;amp; Sang&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Now to the most awaited gift section. It was exactly what I was planning to get myself sometime in future. It was a smartphone from Micromax, &lt;i&gt;Canvas HD&lt;/i&gt; and a Samsung Bluetooth headset. I saw this phone being used by Sounder &amp;amp; Karthiga and they gave me a positive review about this phone. Now, I can take up Udemy classes in the phone anytime, anywhere. Thank you pondatti for a lovely gift :)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
More than the gift, its the love and the efforts you put in to make this occasion special that I am eternally grateful for.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
You make me live, when I can't.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
You make me give, when I don't. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
You knock me down, when I am mean.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
You cuddle me up, when I am high.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;span style="font-size: large;"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Love you pondatti... Be with me forever !!!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
We have read business books which talks about starting a business from scratch, may be a step by step advice on what to do and what not to do. Also, we have seen books with the collection of inspiring stories (Ex. &lt;a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2011/11/i-have-dream-book-review.html" target="_blank"&gt;I have A Dream&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2010/07/connect-dots.html" target="_blank"&gt;Connect The Dots&lt;/a&gt;) of the successful entrepreneur who created the business out of nothing. There are numerous books which just have the collection of tips, quotes, fiction (Ex. &lt;a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2011/10/trump-way-to-top-best-business-advice-i.html" target="_blank"&gt;Trump - The Way To The Top&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2010/08/ignore-everybody-and-39-other-keys-to.html" target="_blank"&gt;Ignore Everybody&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2010/07/leader-who-had-no-title-modern-fable-on.html" target="_blank"&gt;The Leader Who Had No Title&lt;/a&gt;) etc.,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is different from the other categories. This book is a step-by-step practical guide for anyone with an idea or simply a passion, to create a successful business. Also, the success stories of the successful entrepreneurs are sprinkled all over the book in appropriate places. When you read a topic / idea / plan from this book, there is a corresponding real life success story in the next few pages. The author Chris Guillebeau did collect extensive amount of data and crammed them into this $100 Startup book in a easy fun to read way. He shows that transforming an idea into a successful business is much easier than ever before. He shows us how to test the idea with minimum amount of money before jumping straight into the business.&amp;nbsp; He proves that the money we have is enough and there are no excuses left to start.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Though there are thousands of thriving successful businesses around the world, for this book Chris considers the businesses that were started with a capital of $100 or less and making a profit of at least $50,000 per year. So, we are not reading about the big corporations, but about the everyday people who identified the opportunity and used it to their sucess. Some entrepreneurs started the business out of curiosity, some started because they hate or did not like the job they were in and some others were forced to start, because they were fired from the job. Whatever the case may be, they are running successful businesses right now across the world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Who is this guy Chris Guillebeau?. Seriously I could not pronounce his last name. He is an entrepreneur, traveler and writer. He never had a job and built multiple businesses. He traveled to 175 countries so far (that's 89% countries in this world - Total 196) before the age of 35. He is the author of a best seller book "&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399536108/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=211189&amp;amp;creative=373489&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0399536108&amp;amp;link_code=as3&amp;amp;tag=booiverea-20" target="_blank"&gt;The Art of Non-Conformity&lt;/a&gt;". This guy knows what he talks about in this book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even if you are not looking to start a business, reading this book may inspire you to do so.You may be surprised at what you can do with the a simple idea or a passion - which you never thought could make you money. I would prefer to keep this book in my reference section and refer to it as and when I need some help. Read it and let me know. Here is the official promo trailer for the book release.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;
What is Dhyanalinga?&lt;/h2&gt;
Its a place dedicated for meditation, consecrated by Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev using Prana Prathishta - a complicated process by which all seven chakras are energised to it's peak and locked inside the structure. It is said that this was the first complete Dhyanalinga in over 2000 years and it's been estimated that the energy will be contained within this structure for at least next 5000 years. This place is located around 30kms from Coimbatore, inside the forest. There are frequent bus/cab services available from Coimbatore.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
My Experience with Dhyanalinga&lt;/h2&gt;
Since then, I have decided to be open to other's religious / super natural / cult / cosmic being / spiritual beliefs, I've been on many discussions with many of my friends with alternate belief systems. I did not criticize or evaluate their belief system with my rational thinking process, instead I just listened. I got to know so much of information that I did not know before. One such discussion was about people having different experiences with Dhyanalinga's energy. Thanks to Dinesh for providing me the complete picture of the process that was involved in creating this Dhyanalinga. Though I did not understand many of the concpets - I know now, the rough idea behind this structure. I decided to find that out by myself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Me, Sangavi, Arthi and three of her friends set out to Dhyanalinga in a car and a bike. The route to this place was really lovely with green trees/vegetation on both sides. We reached the place in mid noon with scorching sun above our head. This place has to maintained in complete silence. So they collected the cameras, cellphones other items in the entrance itself. It's free.I have used the pictures I got from Internet on this blog to give you a visual experience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are welcomed and greeted by the volunteers. If you are the first 
time visitor to Dhyanalinga, you will be shown a small documentary movie
 about Dhyanalinga. I would suggest you to watch it.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
TheerthKund &lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-N-5iM2u4SZA/UiWByiryHSI/AAAAAAAAVpg/3pJ1xXiNjcU/s1600/suryakund.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-N-5iM2u4SZA/UiWByiryHSI/AAAAAAAAVpg/3pJ1xXiNjcU/s320/suryakund.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Next is to have a dip in the holy pond to energize yourself and to dissipate the heat. You need to shower yourself before getting into the pond. They will provide you with saffron color towel. You are suppose to remove all the clothing and wear only this towel. They charge Rs. 20 for each person. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The pond called "&lt;b&gt;Surya Kund&lt;/b&gt;" is constructed 30 feet below the ground level. The depth of the water is 5 feet. This pond has three consecrated Lingams and an artificial water fall. You are suppose to walk slowly into the pond, touch the Lingam with both your hands and take a dip in the water. The water is so chill and so clear - I could see the toes, nails on my feet. It was as if I am watching through a magnifying glass. Once you take the dip - your body is cooled down immediately with the cold water. This is a surreal experience. I thought this experience is worth the visit to Dhyanalinga.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pIFy_9SaGGY/UiWFf6J7d9I/AAAAAAAAVpo/9cVgb0SsGIM/s1600/dhyanalinga_theerthakund5.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="212" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pIFy_9SaGGY/UiWFf6J7d9I/AAAAAAAAVpo/9cVgb0SsGIM/s320/dhyanalinga_theerthakund5.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
I walked though the pond slowly, touching the Lingams, taking dips in water, standing in the waterfall. &lt;i&gt;I did not feel anything spiritual - but it was a lovely experience&lt;/i&gt;. &lt;i&gt;I did not feel any sort of energy passing through me.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This above place is only for Men. There is a separate pond called &lt;b&gt;Chandra Kund&lt;/b&gt; which is reserved for women visiting Dhyanalinga.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I strongly suggest you to take a dip, whether you are religious or not. Its a lovely experience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Linga Bhairavi Temple&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WtkOBiPe0Xc/UiWINQWv4HI/AAAAAAAAVp0/HjYu-PS5RIo/s1600/Sadhguru-Mystic-sub-LingaBhairavi-4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WtkOBiPe0Xc/UiWINQWv4HI/AAAAAAAAVp0/HjYu-PS5RIo/s320/Sadhguru-Mystic-sub-LingaBhairavi-4.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
There are volunteers everywhere to guide you to the places and to answer your questions. The old volunteer in front of this temple, explained that this is the feminine form of Lingam. You can worship Linga Bhairavi as you would do to other Hindu gods. There are requests made to her, in exchange for flowers and poojas. A typical Hindu establishment. I seriously do not see a need for this temple inside a meditation place.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I saw a lot of foreigners in saffron dresses doing poojas, offering flowers, doing meditations etc. A typical scene in any Ashram. She offered me Neem Leaves and Lilly flowers inside the temple. I was suppose to eat the Neem Leaves. It was the bitter than the Bitter Gourd. Luckily they sold "&lt;i&gt;Pasiparuppu Payasam&lt;/i&gt;" just outside the temple for Rs. 10. With the help of the payasam, I could eat three neem leaves. Even though we knew the benefits of Neem leaves, this is my first successful attempt in eating them. I was proud !. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Nandhi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N6JSOA5sxsQ/UiaQukHxKUI/AAAAAAAAVqE/CJEvBDjdO5o/s1600/Dhyanalinga-Nandi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N6JSOA5sxsQ/UiaQukHxKUI/AAAAAAAAVqE/CJEvBDjdO5o/s320/Dhyanalinga-Nandi.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
We saw a small beautiful artificial pond with Lillies and Goldfishes, on the way to Dhyanalinga and spent some time walking around the pond, watching the flowers and fishes. It was good. A big 15 foot Nandi interrupted us on Dhyanalinga's entrance. Its made up of a metal alloy, filled with herbs inside, consecrated by a ceremony. It was painted in pitch black color and looks majestic than the Charging Bull in front of Newyork Stock Exchange.We were not allowed to touch or climb the Nandhi.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Sarva Tharma Sthamba
&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_pE8BiHZaVA/UiaVCvIdgeI/AAAAAAAAVqQ/7NFtFcHa2Js/s1600/Dhyanalinga_Sarva_Dharma_Sthamba.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_pE8BiHZaVA/UiaVCvIdgeI/AAAAAAAAVqQ/7NFtFcHa2Js/s320/Dhyanalinga_Sarva_Dharma_Sthamba.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
We saw "&lt;i&gt;Sarva Tharma Sthamba&lt;/i&gt;", just before the entrance, signifying singularity or union of all religions. This stone has the inscriptions of symbols of Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Jainism, Taoism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Buddhism, and Shinto welcoming people from all religious beliefs. I am not sure how many people actually notice this Sthamba. I did not see a single person looking or checking this out. May be this should be placed in a more strategical place or should be made more attractive - to convey the message.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Dhyanalinga&lt;/h2&gt;
Finally we are into Dhyanalinga. The side walls on the path to Dhyanalinga has stone sculptures depicting many scenes in Hindu mythologies. This is not congruent with the Sarva Tharma Sthamba we saw outside. The volunteers allow people to go inside Dhyanalinga in batches, every five minutes. There are 27 enclosures on the side walls of Dhyanalinga. You can either sit inside the enclosures or in the open space for meditation. The five minute time is for the people who just came to visit. If you want to meditate longer, you can do it. No one will disturb your meditation. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JkO0z9yhas4/UiaX365GWXI/AAAAAAAAVqc/ZgaKwmom_Yg/s1600/dhyanalinga-temple.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JkO0z9yhas4/UiaX365GWXI/AAAAAAAAVqc/ZgaKwmom_Yg/s1600/dhyanalinga-temple.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was surprised to see the pillar-less construction of such a big dome. My surprise increased thousand times, when I heard that this was constructed with out Steel &amp;amp; Concrete. This was built with the ancient Indian technique with brick, mud, lime, clay and some herbs. It is properly ventilated and illuminated - perfect for meditation. It is said that this structure will withstand for at least 5000 years. There was such a silence inside Dhyanalinga where I could hear my wife's earring swinging. It was very serene.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
&lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;"Just sitting silently for a few minutes within the sphere of 
Dhyanalinga is enough to make even those unaware of meditation 
experience a state of deep meditativeness." - Sadhguru&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
I occupied one of enclosures and started to meditate. I expected some sort of energy to flow through me or a sudden relaxation or calmness in the body and mind, as it happened to many others. But nothing happened. I actually slept. I woke up when I heard the sound of&amp;nbsp; people walking out for the next batch. That was a big disappointment for me. I came to Dhyanalinga with an open mind to experience it. The above statement by Sadhguru is not true in all cases. But, I heard from my close friend that he felt the energy (he never lies for anything in life). So, I can conclude that the above statement may be true for few people (may be religious?). Objective failed, but the experiment was success. I enjoyed the trip to Dhyanalinga.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;
Why should You visit Dhyanalinga?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The architecture and construction techniques is nothing short of any other marvelous constructions in the world. It's a must see, if you like to travel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The refreshingly chill holy dip in Surya Kund. This is the best and I loved it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The biggest meditation place in the world, situated inside the forest. If you are interested in meditation, then this is your Mecca.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can book in advance and stay in the Dhyanalinga premises for several courses on yoga, meditation and mindful living.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Though I did not experience what I wanted to experience, I will try once more. Next time, I am planning to stay in Dhyanalinga for a week or two to learn yoga, meditation etc., May be I will experience something new or never. Who knows !&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-O30QQ-3VGTE/UhL5z1CjzJI/AAAAAAAAVmo/hjVSy--KYq4/s1600/early_raiser_wakeup_5am.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="250" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-O30QQ-3VGTE/UhL5z1CjzJI/AAAAAAAAVmo/hjVSy--KYq4/s400/early_raiser_wakeup_5am.jpg" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;b&gt;5 AM Club&lt;/b&gt; - Robin Sharma mentions the importance of rising early in almost all of his books/speeches/blog etc. I tried to join the 5 AM club before with little success. I was very inconsistent and eventually stopped it. Steve Pavlina suggested a simple but powerful tip in this blog post "&lt;a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/05/how-to-become-an-early-riser/" target="_blank"&gt;How to Become an Early Riser&lt;/a&gt;", which helped me to wake up at 6 AM daily for about 6 months, until I came back to India.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Early Rising Tip:&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;Go to bed when You're sleepy (and only when you're sleepy) and get up with an alarm clock at a fixed time (7 days per week). The catch is - irrespective of when you go to bed, you always wake up at a fixed time. No excuses. The first few days will be tough and you may feel tired throughout the waking hours. Once your brain realizes that there will be no sleep after the fixed time, it will push you to sleep early. The natural cycle for sleep will set in. I had 100% success with this technique.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;48 Day Challenge:&lt;/b&gt; Starting today, I am going to wake up at 5 AM daily (irrespective of weekends, travels, party, night outs). Why 48 days?. It counts to one Mandalam. Though there are religious interpretation/usage of Mandalam for doing poojas, it was originally developed by Siddhars as a measure of time for medication. If you do any specific task at a specific time consistently for 48 days, it becomes a habit. So, I choose to wake up daily at 5 AM for 48 days - to make this a permanent habit for me. If I miss a day, I will restart from Day 1.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
PS: You may see many references in internet that 21 days is enough to forge a habit. Since, I am going to do this for the rest of my life, I chose 48 days for my experiment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What to do with the extra hours?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; It's not the waking up time that makes you successful, but what you do in those extra hours does. So, We need a plan to utilize those extra hours to work towards your goals or passion or health or acquiring more knowledge or improving meditation skills etc. Here is what I planned for the extra hours.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;My Morning List:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
0. Wake up at 5 AM&lt;br /&gt;
1. Brush the teeth and empty the bowels.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Drink one liter of water.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Meditate for 30 mins (I wanted to meditate for many many years)&lt;br /&gt;
4. &lt;a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2011/09/eft-manual-book-review.html" target="_blank"&gt;Emotional Freedom Technique&lt;/a&gt; with the &lt;a href="http://www.newthoughtfamilies.com/Books/FreeEBooks/TheMagicofChoicesinEFT.pdf" target="_blank"&gt;Choices Method&lt;/a&gt; for 30 mins (I really want to test this on myself)&lt;br /&gt;
5. Read a book or Listen to an audio book or Write a blog post&lt;br /&gt;
6. Work on any personal projects, either technical or personal development.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is not a final list of tasks. I will keep changing the tasks or reorganize it as per my needs in course of time. I decided to spend 2 hrs compulsory for myself in the morning and additional time as the day permits. You can prepare your own list. If lists overwhelm you, just do one simple thing like, listen to soothing music, learn an art, go to gym, learn yoga, learn meditation, watch the sunrise, go for a walk in the beach, walk in the grass in bare foot, write a poem etc., - Do whatever that makes you happy, as the first thing in the morning. Get it?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What NOT to do?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; We humans tend to drift away from our goals every now and then, right. I do. So, I need to have a Not-To-Do list as well, to keep me focused on my To-Do list.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
- Do not Snooze or Sleep.&lt;br /&gt;
- Do not check Facebook for the first 2 hours.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I may find some other distractions to my To-Do list in the coming 48 days. I will add them to the Not-To-Do list and keep focus on my goals.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Why this experiment?&lt;/b&gt; I am beginning to feel contentment with myself, happy with my life (Thanks to Sangavi). A thought of unknown origin tells me - It's time to give back. But, I don't know what to give or how to give. I am searching for a meaning for my life, even though my conscious atheist self says that there is no meaning. I want to organize my lifestyle and channel my energy in proper ways, so I may find many excellent &amp;amp; exciting ideas / opportunities that my entire life would not be enough to complete them. Feeling excited as I write this.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
PS: Today I woke up at 4.47 AM and did tasks 0 - 5 :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Would you be interested to take up this challenge?. What are the tasks in your morning list?. I am curious to know.

25th August 2012 - Some seemingly very unimportant event happened in my life. I couldn't tie my shoe laces while sitting in a chair. I was huffing &amp;amp; puffing when I am done. Yeah. I had a big belly. I could not believe the condition of my physique. I started thinking. Just like the butterfly effect in Chaos Theory, this event triggered a series of events in my life, which led me to change my lifestyle drastically. I started doing one little thing at a time. Below are the list of changes that I attempted from last year.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The last change - going raw vegan was very drastic and very very effective. I was a voracious meat eater. Switching immediately to the opposite side of the spectrum would be very tough. So, I did stop eating meat from Jan 1, 2013. After a month, I started eating raw vegan food for the breakfast for two weeks, then two weeks for the dinner and eventually for all three meals in the day. From 1st March 2013, I was on 100% raw vegan diet. After being in this diet for 5 months, you can see the results in the above picture.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;How does that feel?. Good or Bad?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Physique:&lt;/b&gt; The first noticeable change was in my physique. I lost almost all of the extra fat from my body and I did lose few pounds of lean muscle as well. It felt amazing when I lost few inches off my waist. My body felt very light, I could walk fast, climb up stairs with ease. Before this diet, while on streets, I use to tuck in my stomach or hold my breath to make my chest look bigger - when I see a beautiful girl on the other side or a man bigger than me. That became my nature that I do it unconsciously. After being a raw vegan, I don't have any issues with my body and don't do any of those acts in public. I lost 20 kgs in 5 months.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Health:&lt;/b&gt; I was never sick in the past 15 years, even when I was overweight. I was not sick during the last five months as well. So, I am not sure, if raw vegan diet helped improve my health or not. With the kind of information available in the internet and the research books that I read, it is definitely healthy. If you are not healthy, it will improve. By health - I meant the state of all the internal organs, which is not obvious to us, until something goes wrong.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Cognizance:&lt;/b&gt; I am not sure how to explain this in words. While on vegan diet, I don't have the fogginess in my thinking. I was able to think more clearly and able to communicate that with friends more precisely. I never stumbled for words. They flow freely. I started writing more and reading more. I started spending more time for myself - to improve myself. I invested in lot of audio books and made it a habit to listen to them daily. Started exploring the other side of my life (giving back to the society). Basically I would say that I am a much different person now. I can spend time alone and be happy &amp;amp; content. I don't have any specific proof to say that Raw Vegan Diet did this, but my instinct says it did.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Food Carving:&lt;/b&gt; When I completed the 5 months trial, I thought I would be carving for cooked food. But that was not the case. The cooked food did taste better than raw vegan diet, especially my wife's cooking. I liked eating cooked food, but I don't carve for cooked food. Once when my wife was not around, by default - without thinking, I reached out for raw vegan breakfast. I don't know, if this is some sort of contentment/detachment with food, but definitely better. During my college days (when going out with friends - mostly parting), I will come home around 1 AM in the midnight and my mom use to prepare fresh food at that time and feed me. Otherwise, I will not eat. Thinking about that with now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Social Pressure:&lt;/b&gt; This is the toughest part of the raw vegan diet. We do have a lot of friends and relatives in India. Once or twice in a month, we have to attend some functions (marriage, baby shower, birthday celebrations, etc.) and you will have to eat in all the functions. Not eating in those functions is disrespecting the host. I have to come up with excuses or take the host in private and explain them about my diet. Trust me, nobody understands. All of them told me this, "&lt;i&gt;Eat this one time, you continue from tomorrow. Today is special&lt;/i&gt;". Saying NO to the love of your loved ones is the toughest part of this diet. Another part of the story is that - when relatives visit home and they see me slim, there will be hundreds of questions to Sangavi. All of them were elders and respectable persons in the family and the society. Those were the tough times for her as well. She persisted those times with a smile for me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a problem specific to India and surrounding countries with related culture. So, does not apply for all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Self-Confidence:&lt;/b&gt; Especially when you know that you can do something which 99% of the people around you cannot do, your self confidence soars to the high sky. Overcoming social pressure is the next plateau for your self confidence. You will know you can do things even if the whole world is against your idea. This raw vegan diet brought me self control, reduced procrastination, improved my self confidence greatly. Following Raw Vegan Diet equals reading hundreds of self developments books. Seriously. Trust me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the raw vegan recipes that I prepared and enjoyed are in my &lt;a href="http://www.raw-vegan-recipes.com/" target="_blank"&gt;raw-vegan-recipes blog&lt;/a&gt;. Read and Enjoy !&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Was the experiment successful? &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I do have a lot of obese/overweight friends who complain about the impossibility of losing weight. The whole idea behind this experiment is to find a reliable and healthy mean to lose weight and when I lose weight, my friends will get inspired. I did lose weight. Very funny thing is that, my friends still complains about overweight and ignored me and my diet plan as "&lt;i&gt;Outcasts&lt;/i&gt;". I am no longer an ordinary human being with an ordinary appetite. I laughed at myself. Nevertheless, I was blogging the efforts along the way. If it inspires one person in the world, I would consider my experiment a successful one. I don't know at this point. The comments in this blog may help establish it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What's Next?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Gain muscle !&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;. Yeah. right. I do know many skinny persons in the world. I am going to show them how to gain muscle mass and retain it in a healthy way. I am going to make it as simple as I could. If you would like to follow along, please subscribe (look for gadgets in right side of this blog) for the blog posts. All the best !.&lt;br /&gt;

This is not a complete book, but a booklet. With this content, the author could have easily expanded into hundreds of pages. But, he wanted to make his point precisely in a short text - The Power of Thoughts. This is a much written upon subject in the market now. We could easily find hundreds of good books and thousands of junk books on this subject. This book, by James Allen is the pioneer to all of them. Even after so many decades this book is still being studied by most of the personal development gurus around the world. This book is being recommended again and again by many of my favorite authors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is not under copyright law. The eBook / Audio book versions are available for free in the internet. Feel free to pick up the version that suits you and spend roughly 30 mins to read or 45 mins to listen. Trust me, you won't regret it - if you read it with open mind. Yeah. That's gonna be tough for many people with preconceived idea about life. If you find yourself in that situation where you could not appreciate or understand the concepts discussed in this booklet, please read this book again in a month or after six months. But, please keep reading until you get the message in to your mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
"A man is literally what he thinks" - his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Everything that you see in the world was once a thought in someone's mind. Persisted thoughts coupled with actions, manifests itself in the real world. I can understand this from a scientist/engineer's perspective - You have a concept for a product or a structure in mind, work towards it, until it becomes a reality. Simple. But, James Allen claims more than that. Any man's current situation, being happy or unhappy, being rich or poor, his external circumstances that he can control or out of his control - were the direct results of the the thoughts harbored in his mind. He claims that we could control our inner character and the outer circumstances by thinking right thoughts and eliminating wrong thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
"Blessedness; not material possessions, is the measure of right thoughts; wretchedness, not lack of material possessions, is the measure of wrong thoughts."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Like a gardener protecting his plants from weeds, we must continuously monitor and protect ourselves from wrong thoughts. He explains this with the examples of rich and poor, oppressed and the oppressors etc. He goes on to explain how thoughts affect our health and the body and the importance of having good thoughts. He also stresses the importance of having a purpose to fill your mind with the good thoughts about achieving that purpose. Even if you don't believe in Life's Purpose concept, he urges us to do whatever we do in a perfect faultless manner. Make that as a point to gather your thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
"Until thought is linked with purpose, there is no intelligent accomplishment"&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This book is clear on the concept that it tries to teach, but lacks the "how to" portion of it. James Allen says "Aimlessness is vice", to a world where most of the people do not know what they want. He does not give the instructions to conceive a purpose or to maintain good thoughts in minds. I think, if he had included those instructions in his book or at least give a pointer to those instructions, this would be a one stop book for all your personal development needs. There is no such thing right?.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Please do read this book and grow in your life !&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
Principle Based Money Management - The keywords which attracted me towards this audio book. With most of my income going towards the mortgages and loan EMI's, I thought I was pretty bad financially and wanted to manage the expenses in a well planned manner. The eventual search in internet made me to listen to this audio book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Audio books are usually the same printed books read by the author or a specialized voice over artists. This book is very different. It's like a play. They chose three characters Joyce &amp;amp; Mark - the couples who earn well enough, but still struggling to make the ends meet, and a Genie character who helps them to plan their finances. It is, as if you are watching a couple implement the principles discussed in the audio CD. They take the typical examples of the spending habits of men and women and let the couple discuss and come to the conclusion about which are unnecessary expenses. I did not get bored to listen to this entire Audio CD and I hope it will be the same for you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There was a financial assessment test in the beginning of the Audio CD. 
You need to assign yourself scores from 0 - 4 for 12 questions. Based on
 the marks, you will know where you stand financially. My result shows 
that I was financially fit. Nothing to worry about and keep doing what I
 was doing. I felt much better after the test (even though, nothing 
changed). &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One surprising aspect is that - this is a very old Audio CD, but still relevant to date. In one of the examples of marketing &amp;amp; emotional spending, the character Mark says "&lt;i&gt;There is a new TV in the market. It comes with a Remote. Why should I get up from the couch to change the channels?. Let's get that !&lt;/i&gt;". I was like, "What the f**k?. How old is this CD?. Am I listening to decades old CD?". I laughed at myself, but kept on listening. It was interesting. I knew some of the principles discussed in this Audio CD and some are new. Here are the 10 principles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Spending is Emotional&lt;br /&gt;
2. When you track it, you control it&lt;br /&gt;
3. Saving is delayed spending&lt;br /&gt;
4. Power down your debt, power up your fortune&lt;br /&gt;
5. Know the rules&lt;br /&gt;
6. The rules are always changing&lt;br /&gt;
7. Always look at the big picture&lt;br /&gt;
8. Organizing your finances enables the creation of additional wealth&lt;br /&gt;
9. Understanding Taxation enables you to retain more of your money&lt;br /&gt;
10. Money in motion creates more money&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I loved the principles 4 &amp;amp; 9. I love the idea of paying up the debts as well as building a fortune, a little by little at the same time. This is similar to the concepts discussed in "&lt;a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2011/11/automatic-millionaire-powerful-one-step.html" target="_blank"&gt;The Automatic Millionaire&lt;/a&gt;" book by David. I will start building the Emergency Fund. The 9th principle is something that I overlooked for many years. I could have saved thousands of rupees every year on taxes. Not anymore. I am going to do a complete analysis of Taxation Model in India for Salaried Individuals and max out the tax savings for this financial year. I will blog about it as well to help others.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Oops. I forgot to mention that this Audio CD comes with a software and workbook to plan your budget. Even, if you are wealthy right now, you may want to listen to this Audio CD in your free time. It may give you new ideas. Seriously, I am thinking about starting a bank :)&lt;br /&gt;

I used to watch a lot of videos, audios related to personal development / self help genre. I used to be passive so far. (i.e) simply watching or listening. In recent times, I decided to follow along and act upon the concepts discussed by those personal development gurus. I begin to explore so much into myself and decided to blog about it. I am not going to blog about every little video/audio. I will post only about the stuff which inspires me. So, if any one of these blog posts help at least one of you, the purpose of this blog is fulfilled.:)&lt;br /&gt;

Here is what I wrote in my journal, after completing the exercises mentioned in this video.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Experience, Growth &amp;amp; Contribution - I never thought or planned my life in these terms. This seems to be a different and interesting way to look at my life goals. Even though, I had only 90 seconds to think about each category, the output is surprising. Some of the items like "&lt;i&gt;Learning Martial Arts&lt;/i&gt;" in Growth category were forgotten long ago in my life. I am surprised to see that this is the second item where I want to grow. I can correlate the emotional burst I have, every time I watch any action movie and my irrational imagination of me being &lt;span class="st"&gt;&lt;i&gt;Achilles (from the movie Troy - I watched that movie so many times).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/span&gt;This one trait (imagining myself as the warrior) has never changed from my child hood. I think, its time that I feed the wild side of myself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I could see that "Teaching" is the most repeated word in all of the categories. This is something that I love to do in my work. I teach the freshers &amp;amp; experienced professionals in my team on anything that I know or learnt new. I am proud to be able to convey the message to anyone in a clear &amp;amp; concise manner. How ever I get very little chance to do so, when I am in the "Delivery (analyze, design, code, test &amp;amp; support) of projects. Once the current project is over, I would like to take up teaching. Let's see how it goes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks Vishen for showing me the difference between End Goals and Means Goals. (You will know these, if you have watched the above video). I would like to move forward towards the Ends Goals in a more direct manner.&lt;br /&gt;

By experience I know that, given the same requirement for a brand new application - no two architects design it with the same architecture (technology choice, platform, frameworks, patterns etc). How can there be a definite "97 things" that every software architects should know?. That too is a collective wisdom from the experts?. Those were the question popped into my mind when I picked this book from library. I read it completely to understand it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you are a Tech Lead, transitioning to perform the Architect role in any project, then you should read this book to get the general idea behind software architecture. This book is a collection of two page articles from many software architects. Many architects contributed multiple articles to this book. All of these articles touch upon a specific case or feature of software architecture. None of these article discuss in detail about any specific item. Much like free blog posts. When I see a book with a title like this, I expect more in-depth analysis or case study of software architecture. I am disappointed in this front. If you are already an architect, this book would be a good casual read.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Imagine you being in a room with a bunch of well experienced architects, having a casual chat about software architecture with no definite agenda. How would that look like?. Lots and lots of valuable information about software architecture, as well as some conflicting or possibly heated discussions among the architects on specific areas or ways of implementation. Right?. This book exactly simulates that discussion, except that every architect is given two pages for an article and no one can interrupt the other. I would suggest to read this book, when you have free time and don't take any of the suggestions blindly. None of the approaches discussed here works in all cases. Use this book to know, how other architects may think in a specific case and use your common sense to come up with the approach for the problem in hand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some of my favorite articles are:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Don't put your resume ahead of the requirements - Nitin Borwankar&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chances are, your biggest problem isn't technical - Mark Ramm&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Everything will ultimately fail - Micheal Mygard&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's never too early to think about performance - Rebecca Parsons&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you design it, you should be able to code it - Mike Brown&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Give Developers Autonomy - Philip Nelson&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Pattern Pathology - Chad LaVigne&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Focus on Application Support &amp;amp; Maintenance - Mncedesi Kasper&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Business Vs The Angry Architect - Chad LaVigne&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Being in the software industry for 9 yrs and having the privilege to work with multiple clients in multiple projects across multiple locations in the world, I can resonate strongly with the above articles. For each of the articles, I can site a project/application from my experience - for not so efficient design. Every time I raise my voice against these inefficient work, either I will be silenced in the name of "cost effective solution" or I will be kicked out of the project (Yes. Seriously, it does happen even now). I am not being mean here, I can site many more awesome designs and appreciations as well. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I understand that the role of an architect is like a bridge between business and technology. For some unknown reason or by natural instinct, I weigh technology more than business. I want all I create, to be perfect at the time of creation. I had the complete freedom in couple of projects so far. The "REST services" for AMEX iPhone App and the AMEX Blackberry App. Though there were existing technology limitations, I did not do any architectural tradeoff in that project. I was so happy with the implementation. You know what?. The technology, platform and the framework of the "REST services" changed within two years after I left AMEX. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I would like to thanks some of the architects, who helped me to mature my understanding of software architecture, in the order that I worked with them.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Theist:&lt;/b&gt; God's purpose is your purpose.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Agnostic:&lt;/b&gt; Should there be a purpose?. I don't mind. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Atheist:&lt;/b&gt; There is no purpose to your life. You just exist.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[Below four paragraphs are my life experiences. You can skip to the next section, if you want to]&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For a brief period during my childhood, I was a &lt;b&gt;theist&lt;/b&gt;. More than love for god, it's a Friday routine in my home to stand in front of the Hindu gods and recite Gayathri Mantra. I was encouraged to talk to god and even ask anything that I want. I never got anything from God anyway. When my little brain started thinking rationally, there were many questions in my mind around god, religion and pretty much everything else in this world. I did ask everyone I know, about religion &amp;amp; god and did not get any satisfactory answer. I transitioned myself to an &lt;b&gt;agnostic&lt;/b&gt;. I was there for a while.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Slowly over the years, my beliefs were strengthened with lots of observations. When I become an &lt;b&gt;atheist&lt;/b&gt;, it was such a exhilarating freedom, feeling on top of the world. When everyone else I know feared god in one way or other (during my school days), I was the only one - fearless. The downside is that I did not respect anyone (elders, teachers etc), started doing nonsensical things (going to temple and spit on idols - just to prove my friends that I don't fear God - I think during sixth grade) and during the adolescent years, quickly acquired all the unhealthy habits that you can think of. I was leading a carefree, take-it-easy lifestyle, throughout my college days. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then I met Sofia, in the corporate environment - who eventually become a close family friend. I call her, my sister. Would you believe that I quit smoking &amp;amp; drinking in one day?. Yes. Such was her influence on me. She showed me the importance of having a good interpersonal relationship with everyone, respecting other's beliefs, having my own personal values to live by etc. I changed drastically, but not completely. I would call myself a &lt;b&gt;mature atheist&lt;/b&gt;, who has a personal value system to live by.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I call these phases (theist, agnostic, atheist etc) in my life as contexts though which I try to understand life. I would like to fit myself into as many contexts as possible and perceive life from different angles. I am willing to undergo a context against my belief system, just to experience the other side. I never thought about doing this, until I read Steve's blog. I accidentally read this article "&lt;a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/01/how-to-discover-your-life-purpose-in-about-20-minutes/" target="_blank"&gt;How to Discover Your Life Purpose in About 20 Minutes&lt;/a&gt;" by &lt;a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/about-steve-pavlina.htm" target="_blank"&gt;Steve Pavlina&lt;/a&gt; and decided to try it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;How to identify the purpose of your life?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Steve Pavlina suggests the below steps to identify your purpose in about 20 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Take out a blank sheet of paper or open up a word processor.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write at the top, “What is my true purpose in life?”&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write an answer (any answer) that pops into your head. It doesn’t have to be a complete sentence. A short phrase is fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Repeat step 3 until you write the answer that makes you cry. This is your purpose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
That's it. Sounds very simple. The time taken will vary, depending on the awareness level of the people. I took about 90 minutes to complete this exercise. I fell into the low-awareness category. Hmm...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
When I started, I decided that I will write everything that comes to my mind, however silly, wild, nonsensical they are. Actually there were many of them. he he he. Here is how my list of purposes started ...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
1. No Purpose.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
2. OK, Let there be some purpose.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
3. Read a lot of books and learn continuously.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
4. Lead a Raw Vegan Lifestyle.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
....&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
....&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
It was more like a To-Do list, rather than the purpose of my whole existence. I did not feel any emotion or resonate with any of the ideas. After an hour in to this exercise, I felt the urge to stop it and sleep. It was 3 AM in the morning. I told myself that I will not sleep until I complete this exercise. In one hour, I wrote about 60 items and none of them resonate with my emotions. I kept thinking and squeezing my mind for more. I kept writing whatever that comes to my mind. The 63rd item I wrote was, "&lt;i&gt;Finish off this exercise and sleep well&lt;/i&gt;" - WTF?. Is this the purpose of my life?. I laughed hard at this item. This is the first emotion I experienced in this exercise so far. I felt that I am too tired to continue, but persisted for another 20 minutes. &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
A simple thought came to my mind. Suddenly, I could feel the gush of freshness flowing to my eyes (the kind you get, when drinking Redbull during long night drives). I could hear my heart beat. I felt very fresh and started writing paragraphs after paragraphs. The Yurekha moment!... This was strange. I never felt this feeling before for a simple thought. It was item 73 and the the thought is this...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="color: red; text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Should there be only one purpose to my life?&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
We are not like shaving razors or sanitary napkins. Created for a purpose, use and throw. C'mon guys. We are human beings, capable of doing multiple things efficiently at the same time. There were many questions &amp;amp; dialogues happening in my mind around 3.30 AM in the morning...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
Why should we choose only one item as the purpose of our lives, when we are exceptionally good at multiple things?.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
What restricts us?.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
Can there be more than one purpose to our lives at the same time?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
Can there be different purposes at different stages of our lives?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
Can one purpose at one point in time, push us forward to pursue a higher/better purpose later?&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
....&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
....&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
These questions resonates with what I am. If I look back into my life, I was too much into Bodybuilding at sometime. Few months later, I was into Poetry and did not workout at all. Few months later, I was into blogging and then into reading books, into traveling, into raw vegan lifestyle etc. Sometimes, it is exclusive and sometimes multiple items together. That is how I was and I am. How can I choose only one of them as my purpose in my life. It's not fair. I would not be living completely, if I choose to ignore many other interests for one interest.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
I can be a writer, poet, photographer, bodybuilder, raw vegan, entrepreneur, angel investor, social activist, politician etc., at some point in my life and do it exceptionally good. I can be the master of all trades that I get into. So, I can define my life's purpose as,&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
&lt;i style="color: blue;"&gt;Live life with an attitude that each goal of mine should be treated as the only purpose of my existence at that point in time. Keep changing the goals to push myself forward and help others to do the same.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What changes now?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
OK. I identified my purpose in my life. To be precise, I had written down the mission statement of my life. What changes now?. A simple paradigm shift in the thought process !. More clarity on how to pursue my interests in my life. No more confusions. Is this mission statement final?. No. It may, I think it will change in future, based on my new experiences.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
What is the difference between theists having a purpose assigned by religion and me having a purpose decided by myself?. It's the difference between between being a robot and a human being.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
I think, I am moving into a new context - &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;a matured atheist with a mission statement&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; !. Lets see how it goes.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on"&gt;
Have you figured out your life purpose?&lt;/div&gt;

Dark is beautiful !</title><content type='html'>I have been watching the Indian Media (TV, Newspapers, Magazines etc) recent days and I am absolutely irritated to the core about thousands of "fairness cream" advertisements played the media every minute of the day. What's wrong with being dark?. Why do you (fairness cream companies) want to change my skin color?. Why even the well-educated Indians wants to have a fairer skin?. Initially, it was targeted only at women. Now, men too. C'mon guys. Build your body and stamina. &lt;i&gt;Your skin color does not matter, in your most important moment of manliness&lt;/i&gt;. Trust me!.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="https://www.facebook.com/darkisbeautiful" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KaS0L7ApS1g/UbKrPHoVgCI/AAAAAAAAVds/3s-GuBn7zzk/s400/Dark_Is_Beautiful.jpg" width="280" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
I was born into a Dravidian family in Southern India few years (?) back. By the term Dravidian, I refer to the ethnic group which lives in South India for thousands of years. This group includes Tamils, Telugus, Kannadigas, Malayalis, Tuluvas, Kurukhs, Kondavas, Kondhas and Gondis. They speak dravidian languages. All of them were dark. No exceptions. That dark skin helped us to survive &amp;amp; stay healthy in the tropical climate. Back then, skin color was never considered as a component of beauty!. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Then comes a series of invasions by white skinned people up to the latest British (lets not get into the controversial Indo-Aryan Invasion). The races gets mixed up and the people fall into a full spectrum of skin colors. There are many psychological/economical reasons to treat fairer skin superior to darker one. I can site couple of them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1. Economic Status&lt;/b&gt;: Working class people spent most of their time under sun and retained the dark color and the wealthy people tend to be a bit fairer. (Don't think about white. They were just a bit fairer).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;2. Social Status&lt;/b&gt;: Due to the caste systems and the extended British rule, white/fairer people always got a very high social status in the society. During this period, the minds of millions of Indians were influenced by the image that fair skin signifies superiority, dominance, and power, while dark skin represents the weaker, inferior masses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
... and there are 100s of other reasons. This preference for a fairer skin is prevalent in many other countries as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;History of fairness creams in India:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hindustan Lever Limited launched "Fair &amp;amp; Lovely" in 1978, exploiting the Indian obsession with fairer skin tone. It is called the mother of all fairness creams in India. Now, the same product is selling in 38 countries worldwide, generating most of the income from South Asia. The current market is flooded with so many international/local brands. Neverthless, all fairness cream advertisements are based on the mantra, "&lt;i&gt;If you buy this fairness product, you will make your family proud, you will look beautiful, and you will secure a wonderful husband&lt;/i&gt;" - What an insult to the Indian Women?.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just a thought - What would have happened, if these products were launched during British Empire?. "&lt;i&gt;How dare you want Indians look like British?&lt;/i&gt;"... ha ha ha ha... Who knows, next "Fair &amp;amp; Lovely" commercial can come up with this scheme - "&lt;i&gt;We got fairer and we got our freedom&lt;/i&gt;".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What's Next?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes. The most awaited product of the millennium - "Clean &amp;amp; Dry Intimate Wash" - &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;To clean &amp;amp; whiten your Vagina&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Yeah. You read it right. To make your vagina fairer. The new mantra - "&lt;i&gt;No one will f*ck you, if you have a dark vagina&lt;/i&gt;". Don't they know that we are already hundred billion?. I could not stop laughing at this commercial. Here is the commercial.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/9Tx9vVVMWw0/0.jpg" height="360" width="480"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://youtube.googleapis.com/v/9Tx9vVVMWw0&amp;source=uds" /&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /&gt;&lt;embed width="480" height="360"  src="http://youtube.googleapis.com/v/9Tx9vVVMWw0&amp;source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
Not Enough?. How about this. "18 Again" - &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;A Vaginal Tightening and 
Rejuvenating Gel&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. Yeah. The women in the advertisement sings "&lt;i&gt;I feel like a virgin&lt;/i&gt;", in front of her parents.&amp;nbsp; Amazing. Isn't it?. There is no single cream on the market that can take wrinkles out of your face. If there is, there would not be wrinkles on old Hollywood Actresses or Rich women or Wives of Billionaires. I can't imagine how an external cream applied on the skin can make the vaginal muscles contract?. I seriously don't have a clue - How Indian women will respond to this product.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
My suggestion is this - Please don't let them dictate, how should you look, how should you smell, how should you dress, over or under. It's your body. You know the basics to keep it clean. That's more than enough. Let your mantra be - "&lt;i&gt;Clean &amp;amp; Healthy&lt;/i&gt;". Please don't imagine yourself in some one else's body. No one in the world worths it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your skin color is a gift from your parents. It's a symbol of the society, place and culture you belong to. Dark or White. Feel proud about it !. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

நிறமென்றால் நிறமல்ல. வரம் வாங்கி வந்ததடி. என் அன்னை தந்ததடி !!!&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The more I research about natural lifestyle, the more I come to know. The recent one is "Oil Pulling". I am excited !..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What is Oil Pulling?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's an ancient Ayurvedic practice for maintaining perfect oral health. As soon as you wake up in the morning, take a table spoon of sesame oil in your mouth and swish it around inside your mouth slowly for 15-20 mins. The Sesame Oil will turn into milky white liquid. Spit that out. Wash your mouth with water. That's all. Simple. Isn't it?.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Things to take care:&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do it slowly for the full 20 minutes. It takes time for the Oil to mix with saliva and start the cleansing process. You can read or do any other activity while oil pulling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be conscious, NOT to swallow the liquid while swishing it inside the mouth.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sesame Oil is recommended in Ayurvedic text. The recent studies says that sunflower oil is also equally good. Many people love to do oil pulling with Coconut Oil also. You can try with different oils. Just make sure that it is cold pressed and extra virgin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If your jaws pain after the oil pulling session, you are doing it too vigorously. Slow down.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Benefits of Oil Pulling:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The most immediate one that you will notice in a weeks time is whiter teeth and free from bad breath. I am doing this for the past one week and I could already see my teeth getting whiter. Though there is not much of scientific study or clinical trials with oil pulling, there is a compelling collection of data from peoples testimonials (highly unreliable, but there are too many to simply discard). Below is a list of some of the most common conditions people have reported that respond to oil pulling.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Acne&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Allergies&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arthritis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Asthma&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Back and Neck Pain (???)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad Breath&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bronchitis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Chronic Fatigue&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Colitis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Crohn's Disease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Constipation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dental Cavities&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dermatitis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Diabetes (Wow !!!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eczema&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hemorrhoids&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hypertension&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Insomnia (WTF?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Migraine Headaches&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mucous Congestion&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Peptic Ulcers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PMS&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Periodontal Disease&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bleeding Gums&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sinusitis&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tooth Abscess&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
I have read a whole bunch of articles about ayurvedic notion of mouth being linked with other organs of the body. They claim that the perfect oral health helps to cure many diseases of the body. There are evidences and testimonials as well. But some how I am not convinced with the idea. If you have any one of those, please try oil pulling for few months (I would suggest 6 months) and let me know, if the symptoms are reduced.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Why did I start doing Oil Pulling?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After moving back to India, there were quite a big change to my raw vegan diet. I traveled a lot and missed a lot of meals during that time. I missed lunches in office due to work. I could not get Good Spinach for Smoothies. The greens available here are too heavy for smoothies. I was surviving mostly on fruits &amp;amp; vegetables only. I know, I need to get back on track. Currently, I am researching Indian raw vegan recipes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Among all these, One of my tooth in the front lower jaw started bleeding a little regularly during brushing. Out of nowhere, I got to know about Oil Pulling and I started immediately. Believe me or not, the bleeding stopped on the third day !!!. I will continue to do oil pulling as much as I can and post a follow-up blog after few months.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a very simple and cheap therapy. There is no harm in trying this. Please try for a week at least !&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
I came back from UK recently and have to stay in my friend's home which has only Indian Toilet (Squatting Type). When I was using Indian Toilet - Whooooshhh... the whole business took less than 2 minutes and it was effortless. I normally take 5 - 10 minutes while using a Western Toilet. Once I moved to my own apartment which has Western Toilet (Sitting Type), going to the bathroom was not a breeze anymore. That triggered this research about the natural human defecating postures.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's not that I am new to Indian Toilets. I was using it from my childhood. I started using Western Toilets about 9 years ago. Only when I got a chance to use the Indian and Western, one after the other - I could realize the difference. Have a look at the below diagram which shows the Anal-Rectal Angle, while sitting and squatting. I don't need to explain which one would be a better posture for this job.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Anal Rectal Angle while Sitting and Squatting:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Have you ever noticed that children instinctively squat to defecate?. In the&amp;nbsp;absence&amp;nbsp;of toilets, we squat to defecate. Isn't it?. Our ancestor performed their daily morning routing by squatting for thousands of years. During 19th century, with the advent of indoor plumbing in UK, the sitting type toilets were installed in many houses and considered as the improved way of defecating and praised for creativity. Though the incompleteness and additional strain was obvious, no one questioned it, because it was used by the Queen Victoria for many decades. Earlier this sitting type was reserved only for the royals and the disabled.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
Since British Empire was the most powerful and industrially advanced, the rest of the European countries, Australia and North America adopted the sitting type toilets used by the British Royals. They didn't want to appear less civilized.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A Clinical Study of Sitting versus Squatting:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
In 2002,&amp;nbsp;an Iranian radiologist, Dr. Saeed Rad, published a study which compared the effectiveness of sitting versus squatting for evacuation. Thirty subjects participated in the study – 21 male, 9 female – ranging in age from 11 to 75 years. Each patient received a barium enema so the internal mechanics of evacuation could be recorded on an X-Ray image. Each patient was studied in both the squatting and the sitting positions.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;"&gt;
Using squat toilets, all the subjects reported "complete" evacuation. "Puborectalis relaxation occurred easily and straightening of the rectum and anal canal facilitated evacuation. The anal canal became wide open and no folding was noticed in the terminal rectum." In the sitting position, "a remarkable folding was created in the terminal rectum predisposing it to rectocele formation, and puborectalis relaxation was incomplete." All the subjects reported that elimination felt "incomplete" in the sitting position.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;"&gt;
Dr. Rad concluded that the use of the squat toilet "is a more comfortable and efficient method of bowel evacuation" than the sitting toilet.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Advantages of Indian Toilets:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Makes elimination faster, easier and more complete. This helps prevent "fecal stagnation," a prime factor in colon cancer, appendicitis and inflammatory bowel disease.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protects the nerves that control the prostate, bladder and uterus from becoming stretched and damaged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Securely seals the ileocecal valve, between the colon and the small intestine. In the conventional sitting position, this valve is unsupported and often leaks during evacuation, contaminating the small intestine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Relaxes the puborectalis muscle which normally chokes the rectum in order to maintain continence.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Uses the thighs to support the colon and prevent straining. Chronic straining on the toilet can cause hernias, diverticulosis, and pelvic organ prolapse.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A highly effective, non-invasive treatment for hemorrhoids, as shown by published clinical research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For pregnant women, squatting avoids pressure on the uterus when using the toilet. Daily squatting helps prepare one for a more natural delivery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What's Next:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Install an Indian toilet (or any eastern type squatting toilet) in your home. (Best &amp;amp; Recommended)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use a Squat Toilet Utility like &lt;a href="http://www.squattypotty.com/Articles.asp?ID=267" target="_blank"&gt;Squatty Potty&lt;/a&gt;.You don't need to pay so much for a simple device. There are cheaper alternatives available in market. Just google. I never used this personally. So, I cannot comment on this. Just try, if you cannot do option 1. &lt;a href="http://www.squattypotty.com/Articles.asp?ID=267" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
I thought I will never hear these words in my marriage. I feel more loved and love her more passionately than before. I started hearing these words from my love in couple of occasions. Very first time I heard that, I justified her and convinced her that I will try to be the same as before. But, when I hear this the second time, I felt that a serious before/after analysis is required to get this thought out of her mind and make her understand, how to make things work for each other without ignoring the changes. Hmmm... this phase seems inevitable in every marriage.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Did I really change after marriage?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
Yes. I did. While dating, I was a careless rogue and a romantic poet who cares about only one thing - Love. Nothing else. Never bothered to go to work. Never bothered about my career. Never cared about my finances. Side effects of dopamine and serotonin?.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
After marriage, I have a home and a whole bunch of expenses to take care. I had to be very proper with the finances. I need to be regular to work. I cannot be care free anymore. Suddenly, going out required planning. Going to theaters means reading reviews about the movies and choose it wisely (?) etc.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is it a positive change?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
Yes. It is. I became more organized and become good at planning. I used to spend couple of hours in the morning for myself. To make that time for me again, I started waking up 6 AM every day. I started reading a lot of books again. I started concentrating on diet and exercise. I stopped eating junk foods and going to parties. I became a raw vegan. I spent most of the evenings and the weekends with her.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
What confused me is that I became a better person, but she felt that we grow apart !!!&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Analysis:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
I have to find out what is happening with us.But, I don't know where to start. Simply, I listed down the activities I like to do and asked her to do the same thing. Once we had two lists, I plotted them in a Venn diagram. Here is what our "Relationship Venn Diagram" looks like.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--FIuJDF7MZY/UY2qaOvAKDI/AAAAAAAAVY0/9RD9d-W5HJ4/s1600/Relationship-Venn-Diagram.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="480" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--FIuJDF7MZY/UY2qaOvAKDI/AAAAAAAAVY0/9RD9d-W5HJ4/s640/Relationship-Venn-Diagram.jpg" width="640" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Findings:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ol style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We both have a set of activities that we love to do together.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We do have a disjointed set of unrelated&amp;nbsp;activities&amp;nbsp;that we love to do with/without the other.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: #cc0000;"&gt;We cannot simply do the common activities forever, no matter how deep in love we are.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We must spend time on other activities with/without the better half.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;i&gt;The success of the marriage depends on how efficiently we allocate time on common &amp;amp; uncommon activities.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
I am glad that we did this exercise last night. We will try to add more things to our common interests and give enough time &amp;amp; space for the other person to pursue his/her own interests. We will make sure that the other person is actively engaged in some activity while, we do our own activities. Simply plotting the Venn Diagram provided such an insight and initiated a thought process which helped us to look at the same things differently. I wish every couple does this exercise and keeps the list updated every six months.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Please do this if you are in a relationship, it helps you both !..&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

What is God?. Why do I keep stumbling upon books which discusses the concept of God. The more I declare that I don't believe in god, the more books I get to read about God. I don't think much about 'God'. But when I do, I got lost in a very lengthy monologue.I thank the author Jesse Bering for a different insight to the God concept.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book, "The God Instinct" uses hard science to show that God is not a delusion, but a sophisticated cognitive illusion.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Success for our human ancestors must have depended on being able to get inside the minds of those who they lived with, second guess them, anticipate where they were going, help them if they needed it, challenge them or manipulate them. To do this, they had to develop brains that would deliver a story about what it's like be another person from the inside.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Theory of Mind&lt;/b&gt; is the ability to think, what the other person might be thinking about us or about anything else at any specific time. This developed cognitive ability helped the small group of humans survive and grow in numbers. This ability protected the group by identifying the anti-social elements in the group and removing them. This ability also alerts the individuals that they are being watched for their anti-social activities by the other members. Development of languages and human gossips led the anti-social act of a member being remembered and gossiped, long after it was done - which affected that member's reproductive success. This awareness of being watched eventually led to the belief of being watched by an supernatural agent or God!.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you still cannot conceive the idea, think about this. You are in a shopping mall and you see a person wearing atrociously colorful, old fashioned dress and you asked yourself, what on earth these people were thinking when they looked in the mirror - you have a theory of mind in perfect working order. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How humans developed this ability in first place?. Why on earth that only human's brain were rewired to have this capability?. Possibly due to cooking? and the abundance of nourishment the human brain received helped to grow bigger and form more neural connections? and one of those connections happened to have this ability?. God only knows... he he he he...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Signs &lt;/b&gt;- We see other people as more than just their bodies, we also tend to see natural events as more than just natural events. We seem to think that there are subtle messages, signs or cues that god or other supernatural agent is trying to communicate to us - often to us alone. The belief that each and every individual is being watched by god naturally leads us to think that god must communicate to us about our immoral acts and show us the right way. Since this communication must be unique to us, our brain tries to decipher so-called hidden messages from very ordinary natural events. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Not all of us expects to see god's messages. People with autism will not be able to decipher the hidden subtle messages in natural events. Does this mean that God cannot communicate to these people?. On the other side, people with paranoid schizophrenia see persoanl signs and messages in nearly everything, living most of their lives in hallucinations. Also, do children has this ability to read messages?. Not until their brain is matured and populated with the beliefs. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These are just two of the many concepts discussed in this book. This book is from an evolutionary psychologist. So, expect a lot of clinical trials, thought experiments, quotes from other authors, snippets from science and psychology journals. This book keeps your interests alive till the last page. You would definitely want to discuss or tell these concepts to someone you know. My perspective about God is becoming more clear and more convincing now. Of course with the few unanswered, but very important questions. I am happy that I am approaching so called God or a Cognitive Illusion, one step at a time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thank you Jesse Bering.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
A Vegan book review from a voracious meat eater?. Yeah. I had the assumption that meat eaters are stronger and have more endurance than vegans. I always assumed that vegans lack protein from plant based diet. Until, I saw this &lt;a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2013/01/cooked-food-vs-raw-vegan-food.html"&gt;video&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and heard that the author of this book Brendan Brazier, is an Ironman athlete, who lives on 100% plant based diet. Whoohooh... (&lt;i&gt;An Ironman Triathlon is a race consisting of a 2.4-mile (3.86 km) swim, a 112-mile (180.25 km) bicycle ride and a marathon 26.2-mile (42.2 km) run, raced in that order and without a break.&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
A raw vegan food eater, Brendan can complete this race within 9 hours (on par with the worlds best athletes, who eat meat and supplements). This intrigued me so much that I decided to try this diet for three months. Let's measure this book's claims after three months. Let's see the gist of what this is book has in store for us.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We all know about stress. Right?. The very first section of the book discusses about the complimentary, uncomplimentary and production stress. He also discusses in detail on psychological, environmental and nutritional stress. Why so much details about stress in a book where we expect set of recipes?.Because, this is not a recipe book. This is a complete health book, which will transform your body, your lifestyle and assist you with the transformation process. Recipes spread across the book is to ease your transition efforts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Nutritional Stress&lt;/b&gt; - caused by food because of its unhealthy properties. Not eating the right nutrient rich food, at the right amount and at right interval, places a considerable amount of stress in our body and eventually in our mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;High Net Gain Foods&lt;/b&gt; - Another important aspect of food calories which we conveniently ignore, is the energy spent by the body to digest, assimilate and eliminate the food from our body. If you consume, 100 calories and your body spends 50 calories in the digestion process, your effective calorie consumption is 50 calories + stress on your body. All of the thrive diet recipes are high net gain foods.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;One Step Nutrition&lt;/b&gt; - describes the food containing nutrients already in the form usable by the body. Most of the cooked foods has the complex forms of the nutrients, which must be broken down to simpler form for the body to absorb it. Most thrive diets have simpler form. Very Important!.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Complex Carbohydrates to Simple Carbohydrates&lt;br /&gt;
Fat to Fatty Acids&lt;br /&gt;
Protein to Amino Acids&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Exercise for an ageless body&lt;/b&gt; - There is no magical diet or pill which will give you the perfect body without exercises. The Thrive Diet is no exemption. Exercise is one of the best complimentary stress. When you exercise, you break down some of the cells in your body and your body regenerates when it is provided with the right nutrients. The more frequently your body regenerates, the more young you will be. Brendan suggest the natural forms of sports drinks and supplements, before, during and after the exercises. You can make all of them at home. Specific recipes for specific levels of exercises. I love it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Foods &amp;amp; Nutrients&lt;/b&gt; - A big chapter is dedicated to explain in detail, all the nutrients your body needs (carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins, mineral etc), the food soruces that are rich in those nutrients and the best way to consume them. Just for this chapter, I love to keep this book as a reference in my library.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Vitamin B12&lt;/b&gt; - One "beaten to death" discussion against raw foods is the unavailability of Vitamin B12 in the raw foods. Brendan suggests that B12 is available in &lt;i&gt;chlorella (sea plant), miso and nutritional yeast&lt;/i&gt; and he consumes them regularly. However, the availability of these foods around the world is a big question.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some raw foodists, suggest to take vitamin supplements. I don't like medicine. So, I will not. But, I will try to eat a cup of curd / milk daily to compensate for Vitamin B12, till I get a reliable, consistent supply of natural sources of this vitamin. I am not for / against raw or cooked foods. I am looking for the perfect diet for human body. If the blend of both is the best, I will go for it. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I strongly suggest everyone to read this book, even if you don't have plans to eat raw food. If you eat cooked food, you MUST know what happens to your body. Ignorance is not bliss !!!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Common Myth:&lt;/b&gt; Raw food eaters are skinny and it's impossible for them to pack on muscles.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I believed in this myth for a very long time.&amp;nbsp;Who wants to be skinny and vulnerable?. Not me. Just like any other man, I always wanted to be big and strong. If I get options to either live for 30 years, big and strong or live for 100 years skinny but very healthy, I will always choose the first option. But, if I can be big, strong, healthy and can live for 100 years, why would not I say YES?. The next question is how?. The above video explains it all. All claims in this video are true?. I do not know at this point. But there are strong supporting evidences.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Let's analyze from evolution point of view.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2IfFbF9-V2w/UPPjh0CUvAI/AAAAAAAAVJ8/3kfSsrAb7sY/s1600/evolution-human-brain.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2IfFbF9-V2w/UPPjh0CUvAI/AAAAAAAAVJ8/3kfSsrAb7sY/s320/evolution-human-brain.jpg" width="260" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Many scientists believe that the cooked food in human diet is responsible for the evolution of a bigger brain. Human brain consumes roughly 20% of the calories that goes into the body. Cooked foods are packed with more calories, easy to chew, tastes better and could sustain few more days, which gave our ancestor the advantage of having more time to socialize and less time in searching for food. Since human brain is nourished with more food and given more time to think, it is increased in size.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A sensible and logical conclusion from fossil evidences. Somehow, I could not agree with this. If you compare the brain size of the apes between 3.5 million years and 1.8 million years (roughy when Homo erectus started cooking), you can see the increase in brain size. (i.e) evolution is already started.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What is mysterious is, the accelerated rate at which the brain size increased from 1.8 millions years onwards. Since, Action A (Cooking) and Action B (Brain Size Increasing) happened around the same time, concluding that action B is due to action A - does not make sense to me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Let's come to the present. We all eat cooked food and know the long list of diseases/disorders that will be caused by those foods. Most probably, it is not the cooked food that causes the diseases, but the preparation of the foods and amount of food we eat,&amp;nbsp;causes&amp;nbsp;the diseases/disorders. Properly cooked healthy food in proper proportion, with proper exercise helps us maintain good health. However, raw foodists claim better health, vitality, creative thinking, anti-aging and being energetic with raw food. Too good to be true. Is n't it?. Let's see what is termed as raw food.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Cooked Food:&lt;/b&gt; Any processing/preparation of food that&amp;nbsp;involves application of heat higher than 118° F. I seriously do not know, who came up with this number.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Raw Vegan Food:&lt;/b&gt; All the food items that falls into the below categories. Only plant based food. No animal and dairy products.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Heating food less than 118° F&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pureeing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Blending&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Marinating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fermenting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dehydrating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sprouting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eating as it is&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
Here are some of the key points discussed in all the debates "Cooked Vs Raw"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Digestive Enzymes are destroyed in Cooking:&lt;/b&gt; This is the most discussed topic. Our scientists so far, claimed that all enzymes from the plant foods are&amp;nbsp;destroyed&amp;nbsp;in Hydrochloric acid (HCl) secreted in our stomach, with exceptions to digestive enzymes from&amp;nbsp;&lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Papaya, Pineapple and Kiwi fruit. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;So, eating these three fruits after a heavy meat based diet is good for digestion. However, recent unconfirmed study says that, the food stays in the body for roughly 45 minutes, before being subjected to HCl treatment. So, the digestive enzymes are being absorbed and used by our body. More research is needed.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Vitamin B12 deficiency in Raw Vegan Foods: &lt;/b&gt;This special vitamin is needed for normal functioning of brain, nervous system and formation of blood. Daily requirement is roughly 2.5 micrograms. This vitamin is produced by bacteria and it's not available in most of the plant sources. True. However, recent research claims that&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;Chlorella, Miso and &amp;nbsp;Nutritional yeast&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; do have vitamin B12. These are regional foods and are not available throughout the world. So, many raw foodist adjust this deficiency with vitamin supplements (either daily or weekly). However, we could get this vitamin from &lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;a cup of milk/curd/yogurt. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;This would be the simplest way. Even, if you switch to raw food and do not consume vitamin B12, it may take upto three years for your body to show the symptoms of this deficiency.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;You need to eat more with Raw Vegan Foods: &lt;/b&gt;That is 100% true. Due to the low calorific value of raw foods, we need to eat more and more often. It was tough millions of years ago. With the abundance of food sources available right next to our door, this should not be a problem. Even with cooked food, the experts suggests us to eat six small meals rather than 3 large meals. With Raw Vegan foods, we will be forced to follow that pattern, which is good for us. Isn't it?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Reversal of chronic diseases with Raw Vegan Food: &lt;/b&gt;Many people claim to have reversed the chronic diseases like diabetes, heart diseases,&amp;nbsp;arthritis&amp;nbsp;and even some types of cancer in few weeks to few months of eating raw vegan food. Scientific human trials are needed to confirm these claims.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Extreme Endurance with Raw Vegan Foods: &lt;/b&gt;Once I saw the above video and inspired to know more about raw foods, I stumbled upon &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Brazier" target="_blank"&gt;Brendan Brazier&lt;/a&gt;, who is the author of "The Thrive Diet" and a professional Ironman Triathlon athlete. (It's a triathlon race consisting of a 3.86 km swim, a 180.25 km bicycle ride and a marathon 42.2 km run, raced in that order and without a break. He could complete this race within 9 hours. I never knew such things are possible with Vegan foods.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Anti-Aging with Raw Foods: &lt;/b&gt;Hundreds of living evidences are available through out the world in many countries. Below is one such example.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://3.gvt0.com/vi/O6oJA_xhTa8/0.jpg" height="360" width="480"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/O6oJA_xhTa8&amp;fs=1&amp;source=uds" /&gt;&lt;param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /&gt;&lt;param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /&gt;&lt;embed width="480" height="360"  src="http://www.youtube.com/v/O6oJA_xhTa8&amp;fs=1&amp;source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"&gt;&lt;/embed&gt;&lt;/object&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;How sure I am about her age being 71?. 0%. Yes. This is just a video uploaded in youtube by someone who loves raw food. There is no reliable way to verify it. However, my instinct says that this could be possible. Around 15 years back, &amp;nbsp;when I was a kid, I read a very old book in Tamil, (இயற்கை உணவுகள் - I think. Can't remember the title exactly) about raw foods which detailed the health benefits and extreme endurance possible with raw foods. When combined with the proper exercise, I believe this could be the right way of life for me.&amp;nbsp;Only way to know is to experiment it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;I am going to try Raw Vegan Foods for 3 months. If it brings the benefits that it claims, I will continue. Else, I will return back to the cooked foods.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

We all know what "Science" is. But, what does it mean to say that something is "scientific"?. Astronomy is science. What about Astrology?. Main stream medicine is science. What about faith healing? Or energy meridian tapping?. What does the label "scientifically proven" mean to us?. How do we verify the claims of science and the theories proposed by scientists?. If these questions pops up in your mind when you look at the title, then you must read this book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the other hand, Philosophy is all about asking questions, examining arguments and getting clear with the reality. Do you know that Science emerged from Philosophy?. In one way, I could say that Science is a&amp;nbsp;specialized&amp;nbsp;branch of philosophy. Yes. Science was initially called as "Natural Philosophy" until eighteenth century. I did not know that. I love science, read about all possible latest inventions in science. But, never traced the origin of Science. I am so happy to have read this book. Otherwise, my knowledge about understanding of science would never be complete.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book examines the methods and arguments used in science to validate the scientific claims. It will help us to clarify or simplify the language used by science. It examines the logic by which theories are developed in Science. After reading this book, if someone tells you a new scientific logic or proposal, you can validate the idea by your self with various methods. How awesome is that?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The chapter &lt;b&gt;The history of science&lt;/b&gt;, gives us the brief overview of science from medieval age till today's digital world. It's very interesting to see gradual progress science has made over the years and their contributors.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the key discussions in this book are ...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Scientism&lt;/b&gt; is the view that science is the only source of factual knowledge.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Deductive argument&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;starts with a general principal and deduces other things from it. Ex., if we assume that all heavenly bodies must be perfect spheres, then a logical deduction is that there cannot be any mountains on the moon.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Inductive argument&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;starts with observations or experimental results and sets the general principles taking them in to account. Ex., if we see mountains on the moon, then you can conclude inductively that not all heavenly bodies are perfect spheres.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Abductive argument&lt;/b&gt; just tries to infer a reason for a present phenomenon. You don't frame any theory, just try to explain the situation. Ex., if you see an unopened letter on the pavement, you may conclude that the postman must have dropped it (out of million other possibilities).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Logical Positivists&lt;/b&gt; position was that the only valid statements by Science were those confirmed by experimental or observational evidence. Ex., If I say that there is a dog in the room, I actually mean that, if you go into that room, you will see a dog. Simple. It rejects everything else. This concept helped boost the progress of Science in early days. However, the latest relativity theory and quantum physics does not fit into this narrow schema.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The theory of falsification&lt;/b&gt; says that, a scientific theory cannot be proved to be true by simply adding new conforming evidences. If some piece of sound evidence goes against your theory, it may be enough to show that the theory is false. The theory is not discarded immediately. It just means that there is something out there, which the theory cannot account for. So, in theory, if any theory is claimed to be scientific, then it may be possible for it to be falsified.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These are just few of the concepts discussed in the book in early chapters. This book discusses a whole range of scientific questions like "Do we know things, or only our experience of them?", major scientific discoveries throughout the history, how the new theories challenged and replaced the old theories, the observations of those scientists which made them create the theories, the methodology used by them to conclude a theory, recent economic influences on scientific discoveries etc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is a feast of information for those who wish to understand Science in totality. For casual readers, the first chapter &lt;b&gt;The history of Science&lt;/b&gt; is good enough to get a grip of Science. I recommend this book for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;

Thermal Diet?. Yeah. It's from the book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030746363X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=030746363X&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=booiverea-20" target="_blank"&gt;The 4-Hour Body&lt;/a&gt; by my favorite author Timothy Ferriss.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
Everyone knows the basic fact that our body temperature is maintained at 98.6 °F. When the outside temperature falls below that, our body does quite a few things like goosebumps, shivering, burning more calories to produce the additional heat to bring the core temperature back to normal. The hypothalamus in the brain controls the body temperature with the help of the temperature receptors in the skin. We are interested in leveraging the option of "burning more calories for heat" to our weight loss program.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
There are two types of fat tissues found in mammals.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;White Adipose Tissue (WAT)&lt;/b&gt; - which stores fat, also called as white fat. The excess calories that we consume are converted into energy reserves as white fat around our waist and thighs.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT)&lt;/b&gt; - which burns fat to produce heat (also called as brown fat). This is present around the&amp;nbsp;lower neck and supraclavicular regions.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
When our body is exposed to cold, the brown fat is activated to burn more calories (mostly from white fat) to produce heat&amp;nbsp;until we reach the point of shivering, which takes over to produce more heat.&amp;nbsp;Studies shows that our body burns 50% more calories when exposed to cold conditions.&amp;nbsp;Babies don't shiver because they have&amp;nbsp;approx. 5% of their body weight composed of brown fat. We&amp;nbsp;lose most of it as we grow. The&amp;nbsp;high amount of brown fat replaces the need to shiver. Contrary to the popular belief, thinner people has more brown fat !.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;"&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Thermal Diet&lt;/b&gt; &amp;nbsp;- is the concept of leveraging our body's natural ability to burn fat to effective weight loss. Please remember, brown fat works best at the threshold of shivering. If you find yourself shivering, it may be too cold for you and it is possible to slip into the state of hypothermia, if you are not careful. So, always have an option of getting to a warmer condition, if required.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;"&gt;
&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;Extreme cold could cause complications for people with cardiovascular problems. So,&amp;nbsp;Please consult with your physician before attempting any of the suggestions below. Please consult even if you don't have any health problems.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both;"&gt;
&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Drink Cold Water:&lt;/b&gt; Drink a glass of ice cold water as soon as you wake up followed by a breakfast in next 30 mins (refer &lt;a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/08/building-perfect-physique-tip-1-eat.html"&gt;Tip 1&lt;/a&gt;). Through out the day, drink a lot of ice cold water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Use Ice Packs:&lt;/b&gt; Place and Ice Pack on the back of your neck and top of your chest for 30 minutes, while reading or watching TV. Use the idle time to lose weight !&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Go for "Chill" walks:&lt;/b&gt; In cold climate, walk in the streets with normal dress (may be summer dress) for 10 - 15 mins. Be sure to cover your head, neck, hands and feet as they become numb, in extreme cold. I suggest to carry your jacket or coat with you, should you get yourself warmed immediately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take Cold Showers:&lt;/b&gt; Tim Ferriss suggests a 30 mins of cold shower for maximum benefit, but shorter showers also help.&amp;nbsp;Gradually&amp;nbsp;reduce the temperature in the shower and stand in the cold water for 3 - 5 minutes, before getting out. People living in warmer countries or do not have the access to temperature controlled showers, can try to shower in normal / cold water (without heating).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Take Ice Baths:&lt;/b&gt; Fill your bath tub with cold water and put as much ice cubes as you can. Immerse yourself into the water upto your waist for 10 minutes, then up to your neck with your hands out for next 10 minutes. You can change the time &amp;amp; temperature as it works for you. Tim Ferris takes three ice baths per week.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Go Outdoors for Exercise:&lt;/b&gt; If you live in cold climate, try to exercise outdoors where you can burn more calories. Go for running, jogging or biking etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Water Exercise or Sports:&lt;/b&gt; If you can, involve in any sport or exercise that is done in water.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Seriously, its been hell of a three months. I was religiously following all the tips on every single day. I lost three kilograms of weight in the first month and slowly gained it back at the end of three months. Now, I am exactly at the same point where I started. This is not what you expect from me. Isn't it?. But, this is the truth. When I told this to my friends, everyone has their version of the same story. Hmm... Looks like a universal problem !&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When I started this programme to lose weight, I was supercharged initially and unconsciously I reduced the amount of food that I eat. My wife use to complain everyday. Gradually, my wife's complaints stopped. You guessed it right. I am back to square one. Does this mean that all these tips wont work?. A hell NO. May be, I am missing a key ingredient. May be, these tips are supposed to work together, complement each other to be effective.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, I am gonna add one more ingredient&amp;nbsp;to my plan. Physical Exercises.&amp;nbsp;Wait.. wait.. I am not going to join the gym today.. OK. I am gonna start is slow and steady. Take small baby steps to my dream of having a six pack beach body. I should choose an exercise, which must be simple to start, but very effective. So, I &amp;nbsp;chose one of my&amp;nbsp;favorite&amp;nbsp;exercises ever - Burpee !&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here is one video, which explains Burpee for the beginners. He broke down the exercise to 5 simple levels, to make it easy for the beginners. If you are new to workouts, please try to be comfortable with each level, before proceeding to the next. I suggest, three minutes of simple warm up and three sets of 10&amp;nbsp;repetitions for each level. Take a minute or two rest, between sets. Once you are comfortable with one level, you can move to the next level.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

If you already has the experience of working out in the gym, you may start the explosive Burpees, right away. She&amp;nbsp;inspired&amp;nbsp;me very much today. Lets Go !!!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
There is a very old saying/proverb in Tamil "இளைத்தவனுக்கு எள்ளு, கொழுத்தவனுக்கு கொள்ளு" which means "Feed &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_seed" target="_blank"&gt;Sesame seed&lt;/a&gt; to a skinny person,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_gram" target="_blank"&gt;Horse gram&lt;/a&gt; to an obese person".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Horse gram is called Kollu (கொள்ளு) in Tamil. This use to be one of the regular ingredients in South Indian food for so many centuries; fading away slowly for pizzas and burgers. This is mainly fed as fodder to horses for it's nutritional values. Horses and us eat the same food?. I don't mind. Since, most men secretly desire to have few "features" of horses. he he he :) Jokes apart, I am surprised at the medicinal aspects of Horse gram and regretted that I never ate Kollu in my life. I wish I had. Here are they;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent Natural Fat Burner&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lowering&amp;nbsp;Cholesterol&amp;nbsp;levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulates blood pressure and blood glucose levels&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Horse gram powder mixed water helps in controlling boils and skin rashes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The water that was used in boiling horse gram helps in regulating fever&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helps to dissolve kidney stones and expel them through the urethra&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Helps to cure Rheumatism&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Regulating and purifying&amp;nbsp;Mensuration&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Controlling post-delivery bleeding (Pregnant&amp;nbsp;Women must avoid this)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduces pain in dry piles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Reduces flatulence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;... the list goes on...&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Horse gram can be used in variety of South&amp;nbsp;Indian&amp;nbsp;dishes as a regular dhal or mixed with regular dhals. I included the&amp;nbsp;recipes&amp;nbsp;in this blog to help you prepare them. Alternatively, you can use them as sprouts or as powder.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am going to drink a glass of water mixed with two teaspoons of horse gram powder in empty stomach every morning.&amp;nbsp;As usual, I will post an update to the effects of eating Kollu (Horse gram) in my next post.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Warning:&lt;/b&gt; Excessive consumption may increase the body heat. If you are planning to start this diet,&amp;nbsp;Please consult with your physician for your medical condition before&amp;nbsp;starting&amp;nbsp;this diet.&amp;nbsp;I would suggest two times a week. You can increase gradually as you get yourself comfortable with this diet.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Update from previous tips:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So far, we were trying to make simple lifestyle changes to maintain the ideal weight for as long as we live. I don't prefer to lose the weight quick and gain it back. With the previous tips, I was able to lose 1.5 kg in the beginning and I hit a plateau. My weight fluctuates on a daily basis, but I average around the same weight range. The weight does not seem to shed off automatically.&amp;nbsp;So, I am going to change my diet a little bit with this. Let's see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0QfPpmKBV1M/UIz8vu9VpFI/AAAAAAAAVEI/vrV4PsCS-rs/s1600/Prem-Weight-Loss-Tracker.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-0QfPpmKBV1M/UIz8vu9VpFI/AAAAAAAAVEI/vrV4PsCS-rs/s320/Prem-Weight-Loss-Tracker.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
An interesting observation from the chart is that I gain weight the second day after I had party/ate too much food. Very little data to establish this as a pattern, but interesting.&amp;nbsp;If you are new to this blog, you may want to read the other tips ...&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ONrlbWf8I88/UDFtPBFaPlI/AAAAAAAAU9I/ha-IEq8DUUI/s1600/earth.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ONrlbWf8I88/UDFtPBFaPlI/AAAAAAAAU9I/ha-IEq8DUUI/s320/earth.gif" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Saving Mother Earth. The necessity of the moment. So many non-profit organisations, individuals and governments work tirelessly to protect the forests, prevent many species from extinction, reduce the carbon foot print, invest on renewable energy, reduce global warming etc. There are countless other initiatives which aims to save this beautiful blue planet from extinction. Good. I appreciate the idea. But wait!. Does mother Earth need our help?. Is the planet really dying?. Let's trace back ...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Our blue little planet was nothing but solar nebula -&amp;nbsp;the disc-shaped cloud of gas and dust left over from the Sun's formation, around 4.6 billion years ago. It took 10 - 20 million years for that cloud to form as the planet Earth&amp;nbsp;and life appeared on its surface within one billion years. We took the form of humans around 200,000 years ago.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Life on Earth is highly dependent on the Sun. But, the Sun is not going to last forever. This is the predicted life cycle of our sun. If we survive long enough, we must find "another temporary" planet to live, and keep on switching the planets. What are the chances that there are already some species doing that?.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VTfY4k3MaNk/UDHyvE0utJI/AAAAAAAAU9g/EPAGCnoKjqQ/s1600/700px-Solar_Life_Cycle.svg.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="98" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-VTfY4k3MaNk/UDHyvE0utJI/AAAAAAAAU9g/EPAGCnoKjqQ/s400/700px-Solar_Life_Cycle.svg.png" width="400" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the history of the Earth, 12 ice ages have occurred so far and&amp;nbsp;scientific&amp;nbsp;community expects another one as soon as 20,000 years. May be sooner, if we continue to heat up. Earth has gone through many cycles of extreme climates and the climate is consistently stable in the last 7000 years during which the human civilizations around the world emerged and prospered.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Life on Earth has suffered occasional mass extinctions at least since 542 million years ago. These mass extinctions have actually accelerated the evolution of life. Simply the dominance is passed over from one species to another. The best example is the dominance and the extinction of the Dinosaurs.&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;It is not the strongest that survives, but the one that adapts itself to the changing environment. Every species in this world has undergone changes (mutations) to suit themselves to the environment.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When it comes to human beings, it’s different. We changed the environment to suit our convenience. We used our thinking ability to overcome the limitations imposed by nature. We learnt to control the environment, which no other species has ever done before. We interrupted the natural cycle of energy. We did not contribute to the renewal of natural resources and kept on consuming it. We understand the process now, but not ready to give up everything and go back to the golden cave days.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-v13JLsWDxb4/UGFWiFJjHoI/AAAAAAAAVDI/xbe5ns_p1jQ/s1600/Mind-Movie-Brain.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-v13JLsWDxb4/UGFWiFJjHoI/AAAAAAAAVDI/xbe5ns_p1jQ/s320/Mind-Movie-Brain.jpg" width="296" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What is a Mind Movie?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Before I answer that question, I suggest you read this blog completely, so that you know by yourself. I don't want anyone to blindly follow me. OK?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You might be reading this blog in your home or office or at internet cafe or even in your mobile. Just pause for a while. Look around you.&amp;nbsp;Consciously look at each and every object around you. Notice even the smallest things that are made by man. I am sitting in my living room and I could see hundreds of things. My laptop, the table, the cup with water, a notebook, a pen, sofas behind me, TV, Phone&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How many of these objects were there 100 years ago?. May be a 10%?. How about 10,000 years ago?. May be nothing. Where did all these objects come from?. Definitely not from Heaven or from God. We made this. All these things were once, just a thought or an idea in someone's mind.&amp;nbsp;How did a thought become a thing?. We all know that not every thought materializes. Just a thought or idea is not enough. We need an inspired thought or idea - Yes. That's all it takes. You need to be inspired by an idea to manifest them in reality.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What difference an inspiration brings?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Our brain gets around two million bits of information per second and our subconscious mind can process about only 40,000 bits per second. So, the incoming data must be differentiated to important and not-so-important categories and the important ones must be processed. This is&amp;nbsp;achieved&amp;nbsp;by Reticular Activating System (RAS) which is present in our brain stem.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The highest priority filter in RAS is survival instinct. Next comes our belief system about our identity, values, experiences,&amp;nbsp;repetitive thoughts etc. If you are inspired to do something, you keep thinking about that all day and RAS begins to look out for information related to your goal. Suddenly you will begin to see excellent&amp;nbsp;opportunities around you to&amp;nbsp;achieve&amp;nbsp;your goal. How is RAS related to inspiration?. When you are inspired with an idea, you put that idea in your RAS which in turn registers that idea in your subconscious mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The difference between having an idea in your conscious mind and subconscious mind is that, your subconscious mind does not know the reality. (i.e. no negative thoughts) If you believe that you can fly, you will fly (thanks to Wright brothers). If you just think about an idea in your conscious mind, but do not believe that it is possible, you conscious mind will interfere and present you a lot of facts that is not possible. Eventually you may end up not doing it. I am not saying that conscious mind is bad. It is required to keep you in the safe zone (survival instinct). But, it does not have to apply for all actions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;How to get your goals in to your RAS?&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Only one possible answer is "Repetition". There is no other proven shortcuts. Few ways that I know are: (google to find more)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Affirmations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visualization&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Meditation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Vision Boards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mind Movies
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Positive Thinking (Replace the -ve one with +ve one)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Emotional Freedom Technique&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Subliminal Messages (Audio + Video)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paraliminal Messages&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Gratitude&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What is a Mind Movie?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Of all the methods available, the one that is very easy to implement and very good at results is Mind Movies. It's just the advanced version of Vision Boards which&amp;nbsp;project your goals as a movie, engages your visual, hearing and emotional senses. Many people have difficulties to imagine themselves in the perfect life. When you ask them to imagine, they may see a blank screen. Mind Movies are&amp;nbsp;effective because it presents what you want to imagine in the screen before you. You don't have to force yourself to imagination.&amp;nbsp;All you have to do is, to imagine yourself in that movie. Its your movie anyway.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Remember "Repetition" is the key !... So, try to watch your mind movie as much as you can in a day. I suggest to watch it thrice a day at least. Once you wake up, once during the day and once before going to bed. If you have a smartphone please download the video into it and watch it as and when you can. The more your watch, the faster you will move towards achieving the perfect body.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You may not be able to relate yourself to the movie in the initial days. Because, you conscious mind will tell you that it is not you, shut that down and go back to what you were doing. Just hang on. Trust me. Sooner than you think, you will believe that it is possible to get the perfect physique. How soon?. It depends on the individuals belief system that was developed from their child hood.&amp;nbsp;By&amp;nbsp;repeatedly&amp;nbsp;watching the movie, you tell your RAS that this stuff is important and do not filter out any information related to&amp;nbsp;achieving&amp;nbsp;the perfect body.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the message gets to your subconscious mind, you will be automatically inspired to do few things. May be, you will get attracted to the proper diet or you may want to exercise a little bit. Look for those little impulses and act on. When you act, it will feel effortless and easy, because you are inspired. The movie just opens up the possibilities to you. It's you that have to the lifting. But, never ever force yourself to do the things mentioned in the Mind Movies. That won't sustain.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;A gift for you&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I spent couple of weeks to create two mind movies (for men and women) to help&amp;nbsp;achieve&amp;nbsp;the perfect health. I did not concentrate too much on the weight loss, but on the perfect health (staying positive). There are costly&amp;nbsp;software&amp;nbsp;available from the creator Ryan on his &lt;a href="http://www.mindmovies.com/" target="_blank"&gt;official website&lt;/a&gt;. However, I used &lt;a href="http://picasa.google.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Picasa 3.0&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;to create these movies for free. I can tell you how to do it yourself in the next blog probably. If you have good internet connection, you can watch these movies either on my blog or on youtube. If you dont, I suggest you to download the movie to your computer (google to figure out how)&lt;br /&gt;

"&lt;i&gt;The title sounds crazy. If you can lose weight by being lazy, everyone in the world would be slim and fit. This guy is wrong. He will deceive me to buy useless products. I am not going to waste my time reading this post.&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_W_DYpUTiWQ/UEsS9-hBGnI/AAAAAAAAVBc/7hLZc0tKIqU/s1600/Garfield-Lazy-Dieting.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_W_DYpUTiWQ/UEsS9-hBGnI/AAAAAAAAVBc/7hLZc0tKIqU/s320/Garfield-Lazy-Dieting.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This was the typical reaction when I first read about the claim. I did research further and found that this tip works for many people. It may work for me. The best part is, this personal&amp;nbsp;experiment&amp;nbsp;was conducted by &lt;a href="http://evernote.com/corp/team.php" target="_blank"&gt;Phil Libin&lt;/a&gt;, the CEO of &lt;a href="http://www.evernote.com/" target="_blank"&gt;EverNote&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;one of the fastest growing company in Silicon Valley and this tip is published in Timothy Ferris's "&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030746363X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=030746363X&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=booiverea-20" target="_blank"&gt;The 4 Hour Body&lt;/a&gt;" as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Weight Awareness Experiment:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;In 2008, Phil Libin weighing 258 pounds, decided to lose weight by doing NOTHING. Yes!!!. He wanted to find the effect of precisely aware of his weight would have on his weight. He actually made a&amp;nbsp;conscious effort to continue to eat whatever he wanted and got absolutely no exercise during this experiment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LGlQaTzqZj8/UEsWLvAqgBI/AAAAAAAAVB0/VMmtbGLQS1g/s1600/weighing-scale.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LGlQaTzqZj8/UEsWLvAqgBI/AAAAAAAAVB0/VMmtbGLQS1g/s320/weighing-scale.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Experiment &lt;/b&gt;- He weighed himself (naked) everyday around the same time, before breakfast. So, he knows where he is on a daily basis. He decided his ideal weight would be 230 pounds (when he weighed 280 pounds) and plotted the details in an excel sheet with his actual weight, ideal weight, maximum weight, and minimum weight. He lost &lt;b&gt;28 pounds in six months&lt;/b&gt; without making the slightest effort to change his&amp;nbsp;behavior. Unbelievable. Is n't it?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just the awareness of how much you weigh on a daily basis, affects thousands of minute decisions that you make over the period of time, even though you would not realize that. How powerful !&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You wanna try this experiment?. I strongly suggest that you do.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Excel Sheet&lt;/b&gt; - Phil drew three different downward lines in an excel sheet. One for his actual weight, one for the maximum weight he can go up and one for the minimum weight he can go down. The downward slope for max and min weight, follows the pattern - today's weight should be less than (0.1%) of the previous weight. Pretty easy?. The downward slope for his actual weight is his actual weight.&amp;nbsp;He plotted his weight against the excel sheet everyday.&amp;nbsp;It was not always down. Sometimes, it goes up. But the weight reduction is very gradual over the period of two years.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
Looking at the results, I decided to try this. I created my own excel sheet based on Phil's experiment. I am going to try this for 90 days. I will post my graph after 3 months. I am going to measure my weight in kilograms (not in pounds). This is my initial graph with just only day weight plotted.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;ol style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the 'Graph' worksheet, please enter your name, current weight and your ideal weight (what you think, you can&amp;nbsp;achieve&amp;nbsp;in 3 months)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In the 'Data' Worksheet, just add your current weight on 'Actual Weight' column every day&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Watch the graph to realize where you are and be thankful for that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

Its been more than a week, following the &lt;a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/08/building-perfect-physique-tip-1-eat.html" target="_blank"&gt;first tip&lt;/a&gt;. I already feel slimmer (just feel. OK) and my appetite is reduced. (Its true. Trust me). I eat a lot lesser and feel full. I used to eat muffins daily, right after coming from office. I replaced muffins with bananas. I don't have a&amp;nbsp;weighing&amp;nbsp;scale at home right now and planning to get one today. As and when I post the next tip, I will publish my progress also. Within one week, I don't see any visible&amp;nbsp;reduction&amp;nbsp;in weight, but feeling good that I am doing something to build the perfect physique.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Today's tip may look&amp;nbsp;weird. If you google, you could find that 50% claims that it works and others claim that it doesn't. I am going to try this tip and will blog about it further, if it works.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;Blue Color -&amp;nbsp;unappetizing color:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you look at our nature/environment, you would not find many natural plants/foods in blue color (except for blueberries). Thousands of years of evolution with nature, &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;our brain does not recognize blue colored food as something safe to eat&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;. This evolutionary instinct is to protect the people from eating dangerous or poisonous food. Even today, this&amp;nbsp;instinct is alive at some level in everyone. This instinct may spread over the environment in which we eat food as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If your instinct is strong, you may feel reduction in appetite when you eat food surrounded with blue color. If your instinct is weak, it will not make a difference. Nevertheless, its good to try and check it out by yourself. Since this does not require to make conscious effort, I am going to try it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;Use blue color to reduce weight:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4FvLwmz_Y_M/UEsPzioZ_1I/AAAAAAAAVBE/o4U5eIv-7AA/s1600/blue-aids-weight-loss.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="200" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4FvLwmz_Y_M/UEsPzioZ_1I/AAAAAAAAVBE/o4U5eIv-7AA/s320/blue-aids-weight-loss.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Stare at her and you will lose weight !!!&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Funny things apart, there are few simple things that we can do. This requires just the initial set-up and let the blue color work for you. You are free to choose the shade of blue you like. Don't make the dining room, a dull place.&amp;nbsp;Be as creative as you can and make it interesting.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cover your dining table with blue color&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use blue colored plates for eating&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paint your dining area in blue color. (if possible)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wear blue shaded sunglasses (WTF?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6upL4kGy1ug/UEcCS4eq2AI/AAAAAAAAVAE/44dmSF03S68/s1600/blue-dining-table.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-6upL4kGy1ug/UEcCS4eq2AI/AAAAAAAAVAE/44dmSF03S68/s320/blue-dining-table.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;Sunglasses to lose weight:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; It may sound strange, but people do wear blue color shaded sunglasses to avoid themselves from overeating. They claim that it works and started selling weight-loss-sunglasses. As with any advancement in technology, it started in Japan. Check out the advertisement by clicking the image.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.yumetai.co.jp/shop/g/g08426000000/" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="203" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-vqzxErMvGsQ/UEcD5NmWBnI/AAAAAAAAVAM/SDus5Nb_Rc8/s320/weightloss-glasses.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Why am I interested in this thing, with the claims of a bunch of unknown people, and unknown doctors and no proved evidence in science?. Just because, Johnny Depp tried this to reduce weight for one of his movies (he he he he... the blue color could be a co-incidence also). I am not mad enough to wear a blue color sunglasses all day, but I would try other options in the dining area.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mn-0wLWsAKg/UEcFzp0MOuI/AAAAAAAAVAU/gBlFnNUhEuE/s1600/johnny-Depp-Blue-Sunglass.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-mn-0wLWsAKg/UEcFzp0MOuI/AAAAAAAAVAU/gBlFnNUhEuE/s320/johnny-Depp-Blue-Sunglass.jpg" width="227" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="color: blue;"&gt;Which color increases appetite?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
We know the color that reduces&amp;nbsp;appetite&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;obviously&amp;nbsp;we would like to know the opposite. right?. I will leave that to you to google and find out. But looking at the logos of the big fast food chains may give you a clue !&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Our first tip is from Timothy Ferris's "&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030746363X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=9325&amp;amp;creativeASIN=030746363X&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=booiverea-20" target="_blank"&gt;The 4-Hour Body&lt;/a&gt;". This is quite a simple tip and would not be very tough to follow. Just eat your breakfast as soon as you wake up, preferably within 30 minutes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have the habit of drinking 500 ml of water every morning as soon as I wake up which helps to&amp;nbsp;cleanse&amp;nbsp;my body and have a clean bowel movement. I believe many of you have this habit as well. What to do now?. Eat breakfast first or drink water first?.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;My Schedule for an early breakfast:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is what I did yesterday ...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Wake up by 6.30 AM&lt;br /&gt;
2. Brush my teeth - 5 mins&lt;br /&gt;
3. Drink a big glass of water (that has the same effect of drinking a&amp;nbsp;liter&amp;nbsp;of water - from my experience)&lt;br /&gt;
4. Prepare the cereals and wait for 15 mins&lt;br /&gt;
5. Start eating breakfast. (Within 30 minutes)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I eat a big bowl of cereals/muesli&amp;nbsp;with cold milk every day. &amp;nbsp;I like the taste and the less time it takes to prepare. I have been eating the same breakfast for over 5 years now and I never got bored with this food. However, not many of you are like me. Many of you prefer a variety of breakfast. In that case, it would not be possible to prepare the breakfast within 30 minutes. At least try to eat your breakfast within an hour.&amp;nbsp;If you are married or having someone to prepare your breakfast, you are lucky. All others, plan for a week ahead for your breakfast and stick to it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many of us wake up an hour or so before the work time and hurry up the morning routine. Eating breakfast is generally the last thing that people do and are very susceptible to skip it. If that is the case with you, please try to wake up a little bit earlier (how little is up to you) and eat breakfast as the first thing in the morning.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Never ever skip the breakfast.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That's one of the surest way to gain weight. Eating breakfast early resets the metabolism. Think this, you have been fasting for 8+ hour and you must break it. Isn't it?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Protein Rich breakfast:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Generally I tend to eat simple breakfast with lot of carbohydrates (to give us energy throughout the day). I do that till today. I would say, I was ignorant of the importance of protein in the breakfast. I would stack up protein in the lunch and the dinner, but not in the breakfast. Tim suggests us otherwise.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The more protein you eat in breakfast, the more fat you will lose.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That's amazing. Isn't it?. Eat early breakfast with at least 40% of protein. The simplest way to reduce weight. One important thing is that you must never be hungry. Eat till you are full. I am planning to add 4 hard boiled eggs to my breakfast. (A bowl of Muesli + Cold Milk + 4 Hard Boiled Eggs). I will post an update as soon as I have some noticeable effect of this simple tip.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Drink more water and more often:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;The protein rich meal is not good for the kidneys&lt;/i&gt; - Heard of this statement?. Don't let this stop you. There is no evidence to prove this statement, and yet the myth lives. But, if you have a serious medical condition, please consult with your doctor. To ensure optimal liver function for fat loss, increased hydration is a must. Make special efforts to drink more water everyday.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I take one liter bottle to Office everyday and complete the bottle twice (1 - morning till afternoon, 2 - afternoon till evening). I feel the need to urinate often, when I do this, which is actually good for my body. This gives me break from the glazing at the monitor&amp;nbsp;continuously, which is a good thing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, today's tip is very simple. Here is the summary.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Eat breakfast within an hour of waking up (preferably within 30 mins)&lt;br /&gt;
2. Eat Protein Rich breakfast (at least 40%)&lt;br /&gt;
3. Drink more water and more often.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
Funny. Isn't it?. Yeah. "Before &amp;amp; After marriage" is just for fun.&amp;nbsp;The idea is the transformation of my body within few months after coming to UK.&amp;nbsp;The first picture was taken on June 2, 2011 in Los Angeles and the second one on Aug 22, 2012 in London. I did not go to gym from July 2011&amp;nbsp;onward, my food habits did not change very much and I retained the same body structure till mid 2012. I am officially into the "&lt;i&gt;Overweight&lt;/i&gt;" category as of August 22, 2012. I believe, I was in this category for quite some time and I did not realize it. Weighing 80&amp;nbsp;kg&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;at 5 feet 6 inches&amp;nbsp;in my 29th year, pushed my BMI to 28.34. Within few months, I may move into the Obese category if I do not act now.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
My body transformation is due to the same old reasons. &lt;i&gt;Sedentary lifestyle and consumption of excessive calories&lt;/i&gt;. What was changed in my diet?. hmm...&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Muffins... Muffins... Muaaahhh...&lt;/i&gt; Yeah, I begin to eat muffins everyday, after coming to UK... Thanks to my wife. (She eats as much as I do and surprisingly she remains slim). I would say, "&lt;i&gt;A muffin a day, keeps your six packs away&lt;/i&gt;".&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
For me to get back to old shape is pretty easy. I am very much used to controlling the diet and regular workouts. I can get back to that shape in 3 months time. (&lt;i&gt;Any one willing to bet a million pounds on this?&lt;/i&gt;). But, I am not going to do that. When I was in perfect shape, I use to advice my overweight/obese friends on diets and workouts. Few attempted, but none of them followed through. What was holding them?. I think, I know a little bit now. We don't consider our body as a gift, but an excess luggage.&amp;nbsp;We begin to detach ourselves from our body and in extreme cases, we hate our body.&amp;nbsp;Our mind prefers to do other seemingly important tasks than paying attention to the body needs.&amp;nbsp;With this mindset, it's extremely difficult for the overweight/obese people to hit the gym everyday. That's fair. Yeah.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
The point is... &lt;i&gt;Building the perfect physique&lt;/i&gt; is not that tough and hard. I use to hear a lot of simple techniques to lose weight from my friends, relatives, internet etc... I never attempted to try any of them other than the tough workouts. This time, its going to be different. I am going to choose few of these tips and try them one at a time. The only filtering criteria is, "&lt;i&gt;It should be simple and should not demand a drastic change in lifestyle&lt;/i&gt;". However, I see those simple changes as simple lifestyle changes. Eventually our lifestyle and habit changes to a certain point that being overweight/obese is something that you cannot even think of or you would laugh at it. Yeah. that's the goal.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
What are all the tips that I am going to try?. I do not know at this point. I am gonna research and use my body as a guinea pig for all those experiments. I don't want to walk this journey alone. I prefer company. If you are overweight/obese or just want to shed few pounds off or just to keep yourself fit, you can follow me in this journey. I will try to blog as much as I can about the experiments and post the results as well. This is not a &lt;i&gt;Six-Packs-In-Six-Weeks&lt;/i&gt; program. This is a slow journey. I cannot guarantee you results. It depends on the individuals. You may see results or may not. You are responsible for all your actions. Please check with your doctor, before attempting any of the experiments that I am going to blog about.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;

We all have desires. Isn't it?. I desire everything that attracts me. If I like an activity, I want to do it. If I like a &amp;nbsp;product, I want to have it. If I like a person, I want to have a relationship with him/her. I believe, many are like me. Ever wondered, Why do we have desire to do anything at all?. What triggers these desires?. Why some desires are stronger than others?. Why do people even risk their life for love, power or money?. This book has answers for these questions, in a way that is tough to digest.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The author William Irvine is a professor of Philosophy at Wright State University. This book shows his rich experience in philosophy. He is able to take us from the ground level to the level where we can understand what he has to say. All his discussions are based on philosophy, reasoning, Darwinism and a lot of scientific evidences. He starts the book with the basic discussions on desire and moves on to the science and evolution of desire and finishes the book with the dealing of desires. He uses a lot of examples to explain each and every concept clearly.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One such example: If I am hungry, I will find the keys, start the car, drive to the nearest restaurant, eat anything that is available and end my hunger pangs. A very ordinary, day to day activity for many people.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are hungry and you need to end your hunger pangs. To accomplish that, you find the car key and drive to the restaurant. If you are not hungry, you would not have driven to the restaurant. The anxiety to end the hunger pangs is called &lt;b&gt;Terminal Desire&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;(wanted for its own sake). The other desires that you form to accomplish your terminal desire are called &lt;b&gt;Instrumental Desires&lt;/b&gt;&lt;b&gt;.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of our terminal desires are formed by our emotions and all of our instrumental desires are formed by our intellect. Surprisingly, emotions win over intellect most of the time (unless you are enlightened). Most of our terminal desires are the results of thousands of years of evolution. Irvine discusses the possibility of the evolution of desires in species and its part in helping the species to survive and reproduce.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For example, if having sex hurts you badly and jumping into fire produces orgasm, all of us would have perished long back. What makes sex, a desirable thing to do and jumping into fire a strict non-desirable thing to do?. Only Darwinism can answer that question. The ultimate goal of any species is to survive and reproduce. All the desires that helps to achieve these goals are desirable and others non-desirable. All of these information are already coded into our DNA, which Irvine calls &lt;b&gt;Biological Incentive System (BIS)&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
BIS rewards you with orgasm, if you have sex (helps reproduction) and punishes you for jumping into fire (does not help survival). BIS decides most of what we want. You get a perception that what you &lt;b&gt;will&lt;/b&gt; want is already decided by your BIS. Where does the free will go?. The idea of free will is an illusion, when compared to the grand scale desires we form.We have free will to decide the Instrumental Desires, but not the Terminal desires. In most cases, instrumental desires are formed to accomplish Terminal Desires.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For example, if you do not like Brinjal (Egg Plant), you can choose not to eat it. You have free will. Great. But, your BIS decides that you do not like Brinjal (Terminal Desire) and your choice of not eating it (Instrumental Desire), is just to accomplish your Terminal Desire. You may try to prove that you have free will, by forcing yourself &amp;nbsp;to eat Brinjal. But, it wont be an enjoyable experience like sex, that you want to do again and again. With me, huh?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We are not just slaves to our BIS (doing so, ensures our survival). We can, to some extent control our BIS. He discusses the various approaches, involving philosophical practices, religious practices etc. Some of the religious practices are interesting to know. Old Order Amish's submission to higher authority, Hutterites reluctance to progress and Shakers remarkable celibacy (no sex). Most of these communal groups try to suppress almost all of their basic desires for a&amp;nbsp;rewarding&amp;nbsp;after life. So, does the&amp;nbsp;Christians&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;Buddhists&amp;nbsp;to some extent. I actually enjoyed reading this chapter more than the other chapters.Thank you Irvine, for this book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book will have an impact on all things that you see, do and feel. This will radically change your perception on everything. This is not just another philosophical book. This book might save a lot of your time in chasing the desires that may not be relevant to what you are. Please do read. &lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
“As long as you have your eyes on the goal, you don’t see obstacles”. These are the very opening words of the book ‘You can sell’ by Shiv Khera. For a person who is passionate about marketing (of course, me!) this book came as a juicy piece of cake to read and review. What better can I ask for? So, here is the review for the book ‘You can sell’.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Right in the preface Mr. Khera tells what kind of book this is and for whom it is. I would strongly recommend following his instructions in the preface, for that is the best way to read this book. This isn’t a novel which can be read on the go or taken for light reading just like that. Do not expect to read this book for passing time. Please do have a highlighter and a pen throughout the reading, as there are many points which you might need to highlight for future reference. Pen is for the exercise at the end of every chapter. What a way to reinforce the thoughts in the chapter in the minds of readers! The work book ranges from personal SWOT analysis to a few psychometric tests to explaining the points read in the previous chapter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Mr. Khera has artfully structured the book knowing which chapter to place after which chapter. It flows sinuously from one chapter to another without difficulty. No cuts and breaks in between. He has gone to a great detail to mention even the little nuances and discuss about them and their importance. Highlighting of punch lines gets the immediate attention and conveys the message in a nutshell. Adding his personal experiences and who’s ever possible makes the principles look very viable and not impractical to implement.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Though this is a domain based book, the terms and language used are very simple and even a layman could pick this book and understand what is given. And for those who are in the field of selling or who aspire to be this field, this book shall be a pole star to guide you. Of course, at the end of the day it all zeroes on you. Nobody can induce principles and ideas in you. You are the one who understand, internalize and put those principles and ideas into practice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Who is not a salesperson? Anyone who markets himself or his idea or a product or anything for that matter is a salesperson. So, a doctor, a lawyer, an engineer, a politician, a college student and everyone else becomes a salesperson at some point of time. So, you can’t confine this book as a selling practice domain book. It is useful for everyone.&amp;nbsp; Mr. Khera doesn’t feed you with fish for hunger but teaches how to fish.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These are a few points which I found as the heights of selling insight:&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leadership is not a popularity contest.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A good professional only learns the trade not tricks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Selling is nothing but transfer of enthusiasm&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Winners compete with themselves; they better their own record constantly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Losers do not like to get up in the morning, winners don’t like to get up in the morning either, but they get up anyways.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a sales person realizes that the profession is not only about making sales, but involves helping others and solving problems, he becomes a professional.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Though I’m generally not in favor of self-help books there are always exceptions. This book is one such exception. I never found this book manipulative or misleading. It just states the facts and principles for a good salesperson. I would recommend this book to every salesperson and even to those who have taken marketing as a subject in MBA or in any equivalent course.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OaKnWpIng3o/T4E8ja_jI0I/AAAAAAAATz0/oFdHr3r4Afc/s1600/buy+gold+for+cash.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="199" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-OaKnWpIng3o/T4E8ja_jI0I/AAAAAAAATz0/oFdHr3r4Afc/s320/buy+gold+for+cash.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Generally, I do not prefer Gold, in fact my engagement ring is the first gold ornament in my body.&amp;nbsp;It's a custom in India&amp;nbsp;for the bride &amp;amp; groom&amp;nbsp;to wear Gold Jewels during wedding.&amp;nbsp;I had no options but to buy. I head out to "Joy Alukkas". I was discussing about the Gold Jewellery Business in India, with the floor manager and I am surprised to know that majority of the people does not even understand the basics. In fact, my parents were cheated by "L.K.S&amp;nbsp;Jewellers" when they bought 916 KDM Gold Rings few years back. So, this blog may be a beginner's first hand information, when you buy Gold Jewels in India.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I would like to explain few technical&amp;nbsp;jargon&amp;nbsp;related to Gold Jewels...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Carat (K):&lt;/b&gt; Its the unit of purity of gold. As per the calculation below, 24K Gold is nearly 99.9% pure gold.&amp;nbsp;24K Gold is suggested for Golden Ornaments of more than 10&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;Sovereigns &lt;/i&gt;and remember there is no&amp;nbsp;guarantee&amp;nbsp;for the Jewels, since they may lose the shape even with&amp;nbsp;normal&amp;nbsp;usage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AKp5siFc7dA/T4FEJ2IfAOI/AAAAAAAAT0A/r8G_1VLgvDU/s1600/Carat-Gold-Definition.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-AKp5siFc7dA/T4FEJ2IfAOI/AAAAAAAAT0A/r8G_1VLgvDU/s1600/Carat-Gold-Definition.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;916 KDM (or) 22K Gold:&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;Most of the Gold Jewels made in India are of 22K Gold.&amp;nbsp;Cadmium or Kadium (KDM) use to be one of the metal mixed with Gold&amp;nbsp;to make it strong, so that beautiful intricate designs can be made. Cadmium is safe in the finished gold products, but very dangerous in the manufacturing process. Some countries banned Cadmium to be used in gold ornaments. In that case, the alloy would be the combination of Silver, Copper and Zinc. (The % of these metals varies, depends on the manufacturer). 916 KDM Gold is a gold alloy of Gold and (Silver + Copper + Zinc) with roughly 91.6% of pure gold which is 22K Gold. Though we do not use Cadmium in most cases, we still use the name KDM. Look at the below calculation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eZPCt9gB3E0/T4FL_x8wHYI/AAAAAAAAT0M/o-afKWjDsaw/s1600/22K-Carat-Gold-Definition.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-eZPCt9gB3E0/T4FL_x8wHYI/AAAAAAAAT0M/o-afKWjDsaw/s1600/22K-Carat-Gold-Definition.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;18K Gold:&lt;/b&gt; 18K Gold is 75% of pure Gold and 25% of other metals. Using the above formula, you can decide the percentage of pure gold in your gold ornaments.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;BIS Hallmark: &lt;/b&gt;The Government of India formed Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) in the year 1987, which is the only&amp;nbsp;institution&amp;nbsp;in India, authorised to hallmark golden Jewellery. The Jewellers has to obtain a licence from BIS for a fee and hallmark the jewel they make with BIS logo.&amp;nbsp;BIS maintains market surveillance on the certified jewellers, on random basis. Market surveillance involves collection of Hallmarked Gold Jewellary from licencee's retail outlet/manufacturing premises and having it tested for conformity in BIS recognized hallmarking centre.&amp;nbsp;Deviations in degree of purity of gold and operation not in conformance to the system may result in cancellation of BIS licence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e4QtB99wiAw/T4FSdoNzWVI/AAAAAAAAT0Y/LhHAOeb1ESQ/s1600/BIS+HallMark+Logo.gif" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-e4QtB99wiAw/T4FSdoNzWVI/AAAAAAAAT0Y/LhHAOeb1ESQ/s1600/BIS+HallMark+Logo.gif" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Most of the&amp;nbsp;Gold Smiths&amp;nbsp;print the word "916" or "916 KDM" on the Jewels without the logo. Many jewellers will show you these printed numbers and claim that they are 916 KDM Jewels. Do not listen to the jewellers. Just look for the above logo. If you do not find the logo in the Jewels, it means that the specific Jewel is NOT verified for the purity of gold and you are being cheated.&amp;nbsp;&lt;i style="color: red; font-weight: bold;"&gt;Please purchase the Gold Ornaments, ONLY if it is hallmarked with BIS logo.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;span style="color: red;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Sovereign: &lt;/b&gt;It is actually a gold coin of United Kingdom issued way back in 1817, which is valued roughly at one Pound Sterling. The weight of the gold coin is roughly 7.988052 grams. Even after British left India, we still use the term "Sovereign" as a unit to measure gold jewellery.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1 Sovereign = 8 grams of Gold.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Wastage Charges:&lt;/b&gt; When the Gold Smith makes the gold jewel, it is assumed that some portion of the gold is wasted. Technically he recovers everything from the chemicals, the "assumed wastage" of gold is charged to the customers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Making Charges:&lt;/b&gt; The charges you pay to the Gold Smith to make the Jewel out of raw gold.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Hallmarking Charges:&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;BIS certified Assaying and Hallmarking centers hallmarks the gold for Rs.25 per gold ornament. (As of August 1st, 2012). &lt;i&gt;You don't need to pay that amount. &lt;/i&gt;It should already be covered in any of the charges above. If you are being asked to pay more than Rs. 25, please tell the Jewellers that you would pay the amount, but would need the bill to&amp;nbsp;explicitly&amp;nbsp;mention the BIS hallmarking charges and the Assaying center's name and address and you would register a complaint with BIS for this.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What percentage you can give?.&lt;/b&gt; Now a days, the Jewellers combine both the charges into one, (either wastage or making charges) so that you feel you are being charged less. Just a&amp;nbsp;psychological effect. With the information collected from my friends in Bangalore, Chennai and other parts of Tamil Nadu, I can conclude that&amp;nbsp;the combined charges&amp;nbsp;of ...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Less than 8% -- You are brilliant in negotiation. Please teach me the tricks!&lt;br /&gt;
8% - 10% -- Average.&lt;br /&gt;
10% - 13% -- The maximum you should give, however complicate the design is.&lt;br /&gt;
More than 13% -- You are being cheated.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was like this, when we bought "&lt;i&gt;Thali Kodi&lt;/i&gt;" for my wife and a "&lt;i&gt;Short Chain&lt;/i&gt;" for me. I saved my hard earned money of Rs. 3,816 from the Jewellers.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4mJES6C96Ok/T4Fdc0NC9bI/AAAAAAAAT0s/S3kQ4O_THcY/s1600/Negotiation.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="62" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-4mJES6C96Ok/T4Fdc0NC9bI/AAAAAAAAT0s/S3kQ4O_THcY/s320/Negotiation.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Remember the below:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No one does business for loss or charity.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never feel shy to negotiate for Gold. Its your money. Even after you negotiated for a good %, you could as for a flat discount.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Jewellers are already millionaires. By paying them more "free money" you are making them rich. In turn they will open more Showrooms. Who benefits?. Think!. Definitely, you lose.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Instead, you could bargain &amp;amp; donate the money to your favorite charity. Society benefits !.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;While Exchanging Gold :&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;We decided to exchange the unused rings and bangles for the new gold.&amp;nbsp;Joy Alukkas charged 1% of &lt;i&gt;melting / usage charges&lt;/i&gt; (?) on the gold while exchanging. I was surprised. I argued with them that these are KDM jewels and I won't pay a single paise. The manager told that he would accept the jewels from Joy Alukkas without melting charges, but not from other jewellers. Ater negotiating for few more minutes, he agreed to take the gold for exchange without any charges.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Things to remember while exchanging gold...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never pay a single paise for melting charges / usage charges or whatever charge they impose.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Gold must be exchanged for the current gold price. Never accept any price lesser than that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are in a hurry and they do not reduce, please ask them a letter mentioning the charges that you are paying for exchanging the gold and tell them that you will take that up with BIS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you are not in a hurry, move on to the next shop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Once this is settled, another surprise was waiting for me. One of the Golden Ring (1 Sovereign) that my dad purchased from L.K.S Jewellers many years ago, with the printed word "916 KDM" failed in the purity test. It had only 80% gold and the rest was mixed with Silver!. This jewel is from one of established Jewellers in Chennai. Hard to believe right?. Joy Alukkas melted the ring and showed the proof in the purity meter. Here is the picture.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-04GhTtdIYFU/T4ZzjdLxKhI/AAAAAAAAT4g/eiSRKnp_P-s/s1600/LKS+Jewellery++916+KDM+cheat.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="213" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-04GhTtdIYFU/T4ZzjdLxKhI/AAAAAAAAT4g/eiSRKnp_P-s/s320/LKS+Jewellery++916+KDM+cheat.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My Dad used to buy most of the jewellery from one of the showrooms of L.K.S Jewellery, since it was close to our house. My dad trusted the jewellery shop so much that every single jewel in our house is from that shop.&amp;nbsp;But, &lt;b&gt;L.K.S Jewellers cheated my dad and lost a loyal customer.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Many people that I know, would bargain with street vendors, fish markets etc for few rupees, but reluctant to bargain in a Jewellery shop. My mom is one of them. Why is that?. Couple of reasons, that I came to know.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Ego. You feel small, when you are negotiating in a jewellery shop. You don't want others to think that you do not have enough money or you are a miser. Just a self thought by few people.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Arguing / negotiating reduces the value of the occasion (wedding or valentine's day gift etc). If you buy the gold at the said price without negotiation, you value the occasion more than the money. You feel great. Crap!. Isn't it?. But, it is a true for few people that I know. When you buy the items like "Thali Kodi" or idol of any god, many jewellers advise you not to argue and surprisingly, people listen.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Question&lt;/i&gt;: &lt;i&gt;Have you ever bargained in any jewellery shop?. Any interesting incidents?. Any additional tips that must be in this blog?. Please let me know in the comments section.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HSmfmrHDZM4/UNbg2eENUBI/AAAAAAAAVH4/OM0jevLZAEE/s1600/human-mind-thinking.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HSmfmrHDZM4/UNbg2eENUBI/AAAAAAAAVH4/OM0jevLZAEE/s320/human-mind-thinking.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have been thinking about this concept of running a software program without any hardware for quite some time. I know what you are thinking. Let's stop the rational thinking about the possibilities of its&amp;nbsp;implementation. Let's do a Thought Experiment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Imagine that you are a mad scientist specialized in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. You create an extra-ordinary AI program (Software) which can be installed in a humanoid robot (Hardware). There are only two mandatory rules to the AI Program.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;1. AI program should listen to your commands and complete them with the help of the humanoid robot.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;2.&amp;nbsp;AI Program should get rid of it's dependency with the humanoid robot.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Other than these two rules, the AI Program has free will to do anything, it wants to do. Completing your commands is a very basic and simple thing for that AI program. It&amp;nbsp;is intelligent enough to think, break down the complex dependencies with the humanoid robot into smaller simple dependencies and tries to remove one dependency at a time. It has all the resources to learn everything that's already discovered by human beings and create anything that it wants to create.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Ex.&lt;/b&gt; Assume that the AI Program does not know about TV remote controls. You command the program to switch on the TV and tune to a specific channel. Initially, the AI program uses the Robot's legs and arms, walks towards the TV and tunes it. The dependency is now on the legs, arms, ability to walk, operate the TV controls etc. The AI Programs connects to Internet and learns about the TV remote controls and orders one. Now, to execute the same command, the program is less dependent on the humanoid robot. It thinks even further about IR and installs a remote control in the humanoid robot itself to detach itself from the dependency of the TV remote controls.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When the AI Program&amp;nbsp;acquired&amp;nbsp;all the knowledge and created a brilliant data-mining algorithm to find any specific information in a split second, it begins to think beyond your imagination. It decomposes the entire humanoid into groups of atoms working together to perform any action. &lt;i&gt;It figures out a way to control the atoms, without depending on the humanoid robot. A great step which is not yet a conceivable idea for human beings.&lt;/i&gt; It executes the same set of instructions to perform the same action as before, along with that, some additional &lt;i&gt;commands&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;to control the atoms to perform the action.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vsz0h20iOGc/UNbhoGCOTAI/AAAAAAAAVIA/PmkXlhAPcSE/s1600/picture-drawing-itself-hands.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="276" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vsz0h20iOGc/UNbhoGCOTAI/AAAAAAAAVIA/PmkXlhAPcSE/s320/picture-drawing-itself-hands.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The above picture may give you an Idea of what I think, the AI Program is doing. When the AI Program completes its mission - completely detached from the humanoid robot, you can command the AI Program to do anything and it will be done, without the humanoid robot. If you command the AI Program to bring the Apple from the table to you, the AI Program commands the atoms around the apple and you would see the Apple flies in the air and comes to you by itself. The AI Program acquired knowledge, way beyond your imagination, it does not need a "Hardware" to run and it cannot be technically called as "Software" anymore.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Questions to think (still a Thought Experiment, assume it already happened):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;Should the AI Program&amp;nbsp;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;still&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;listen to your commands? Why?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;Since the AI Program knows everything, can create anything and nothing more to learn, would the AI Program shut itself down or execute &amp;nbsp;forever? Why?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Once you have answers for the above questions and if you are a theist,&amp;nbsp;assume that the mad scientist is your GOD and the AI Program is YOUR SOUL. Now, repeat the entire Thought Experiment in your mind with the new perspective. Do your answers change now? I leave the conclusion to yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PS:&lt;/b&gt;&amp;nbsp;I started this blog post as an article on Thought Experiments of future science, but it ended up with a Philosophical Note. I&amp;nbsp;believe&amp;nbsp;without any logical reasoning that creating such an AI Program is possible in my life time&amp;nbsp;itself. Just that I could not imagine our world, when it really happens. Please let me know your thoughts in the comments sections.&lt;/div&gt;

My friend read this book and said, "Its a boring story. I didn't even complete the book". But, one of my&amp;nbsp;favorite&amp;nbsp;author &lt;a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/search/label/Neale%20Donald%20Walsch" target="_blank"&gt;Neale Donald Walsch&lt;/a&gt; said, "Wonderfully entertaining, emotionally uplifting and spiritually enlightening story". Conflicting reviews. Yet, I decided to read the book anyway.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is the autobiography of the author &lt;a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/search/label/Jack%20Canfield" target="_blank"&gt;Jack Canfield&lt;/a&gt; who frequently gets a strange dream or a vision. &lt;i&gt;Jack and his friends are a group of eternal beings travelling through the universe in Golden&amp;nbsp;Motorcycles&amp;nbsp;at the speed of light. They are few thousand years old and considered&amp;nbsp;adolescent in their species. They are enjoying their annual&amp;nbsp;solstice break from the Academy of Enlightenment.&amp;nbsp;They happen to see a small blue planet (Earth), full of negative energy and in turmoil. That was the time of World War on earth and almost every nation was involved in war. Jack decides to help the planet and thought that would bring him good grade in the Academy. Jack's friends are not keen in going to planet Earth. However, Jack is determined to go. So, everyone followed Jack to help the small blue planet. The only thing, they did not know is that, when they are born as human being in Earth, they will forget who they truly are!. And, here is our hero, born in Fort Worth, Texas, United States of America and the story begins !...&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jack's early childhood days with his military father was very strict and would often result in spankings. When Jack was six, his mom divorced his father, remarried and moved to live with her grand mother. That's when Jack begin to live life. He is a very&amp;nbsp;meritorious&amp;nbsp;student and very good at sports as well. He became a teacher and helped to improve the education system in USA.&amp;nbsp;The story details all the little and big things Jack did in his life.&amp;nbsp;From his decision to become a teacher, till he becomes the author of the very famous book series "Chicken Soup of the Soul", he narrates his story well. The transformation of his life and the subsequent realization of who he was, is very interesting. The association that he gets after realization and the good deeds that he does to the society is just like what &lt;a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/search/label/Rhonda%20Byrne" target="_blank"&gt;Rhonda Bryne&lt;/a&gt; has described in her book, The Secret.&amp;nbsp;Jack lived a great fulfilled life.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Along with Barbara Marx, the group of Enlightened Souls are planning to take the entire humanity's awareness to the next level. They are planning for a&amp;nbsp;birthday&amp;nbsp;party for the Humanity on December 22, 2012. I am little excited about the event and little&amp;nbsp;skeptic&amp;nbsp;as well.&amp;nbsp;The details of the event can be found in the below websites.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.goldenmotorcyclegang.com/" target="_blank"&gt;The Golden Motorcycle Gang&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
A good story and a good goal for the entire humanity. But, what does all these mean to me?. What am I supposed to do after reading this book?. Why did I read this book in first place?. To be true, I am not moved by the life story of Jack Canfield, but by the concept of eternal beings born in the world, without the knowledge of who they are. I always have this idea, that I am a super natural power living in a human body. It may sound superstitious, since I neither believe in God, nor follow any religion. The movies "The Matrix" and "Avatar" had a huge impact in the way, that I think about myself. This book is third in that list. What if, I am part of the Golden&amp;nbsp;Motorcycle&amp;nbsp;Gang, who is yet to realize my true nature?. The immediate voice in my mind says, "You are not part of any gang. You would rather be a lonely rider". This could be my super ego, which always tell me to be a leader, not a follower. Never mind.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I love to help people to come out of their fears and achieve their life goals. Why not do that in a big scale?. Help more people to live their life in a way that they wanted to live. After reading this book, I decided to pursue a career on Life Coaching. More to be done. More lives to uplift. Let's see, what I am up to !&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_WluVx9-bIY/T2Tk4_uayJI/AAAAAAAAABA/gKeYt9j5Mt8/s1600/IMG0142A.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-_WluVx9-bIY/T2Tk4_uayJI/AAAAAAAAABA/gKeYt9j5Mt8/s1600/IMG0142A.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was a gloomy Sunday afternoon. I was on the way to the weekly meeting at Sangama Office. I saw a bird flying from tree to tree looking for an apt place to set its nest. It somehow seemed like my life. I’m a homeless wanderer right now seeking a nest. With so many thoughts flooding the mind, I reached the office. It was warm to see known faces and lovely smiles spread across those faces. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My eyes fell on the two strangers talking to my peers and typing the conversations in a laptop. Our head Karunakaran introduced me to those strangers. He said, “They want to understand about us and help us in some way. They will ask you few questions. Please answer them”. With these words he left me with these two people in a separate cabin. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sitting across with two strangers and chatting brings me back all those horror stories alive once again. How much ever tears I shed, they fail to wash away the pain throbbing in my heart. I’m Rosy and here I’m talking with Sruthi and Prem who had come down to understand better about us and to help us in some way. Wondering what is there to help me? Well, I’m a trans-gender. Their questions bring me back all those memories vivid and fresh. My eyes fail me and pour out attempting to ease heart’s pain. Five questions and that’s all it needed to know my past and present. . Future?? Yeah. That too. The questions are rhetorical and not worth mentioning. However, the answers are. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;BORN:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I was born like any other human being without any guiding star or Magi’s gift, though none could have predicted then that I’m going to be different. I was born in Nilgiris but was brought up in Bangalore. Right from early days, life tossed me here and there. During the Cauvery river problem, my family fled to Tamilnadu and I was lost in Bangalore. I somehow found a family where I stayed and worked. I had to discontinue my studies to feed myself. Then after a few years my family came back to Bangalore and I settled with them. By then, our family was in a bad shape and an elder sister of mine was affected with brain fever. Even from those days, I was very feminine and was a victim of mockery and humility. I was doing all errands I could do to win bread for my family. Sounds like any bollywood movie? Sometimes movies and real life are one and the same.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One fine day- it was my cousin’s marriage. I was asked to fetch water. It wasn’t comfortable for me to just lift them with hands and walk. So, I innocently lifted the pot and kept it in my waist: the typical way how an Indian woman would carry a pot. My uncle saw me coming like that and in front of everyone he said, “Are you a woman to lift a pot like this? Shame on you.” I was hurt. But, I just overlooked it and carried with my routine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You can stand any mocking or humiliation from anyone but never from the man and woman who brought you to this earth with their blood. Did I tell that my father is a drunkard? If not know now. That night, he was all drunk and beat my mom. I couldn’t tolerate that and stood up to my dad told him to not to beat mom. Argument reached its peak and he looked at me telling, “You are not a man at all! Pottai! If you are truly a man, sire a child and come in front of me. Then speak as you wish.” Pottai is a cheap word to refer men who are feminine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;So long, I took all humiliations on a lighter note and walked away. However, I couldn’t take this one. My heart was bleeding. I decided to end my life and poured an entire can of kerosene and was about to light myself when my mom saw and ran to me. Between her heart breaking sobs she said, “You are the only reason, why this family is surviving today and more than everything I need you Thomas. Don’t leave me and go. I can never face that.” She poured a bucket of water on my head and burnt those clothes alone. I felt that I should live at least for her sake. I was christened Thomas. Rosy is the name after I changed to this avatar.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;RAN AWAY:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I was so deeply hurt that I ran away from home. Then we were living in Chennai. I came to Bangalore and was roaming here and there. With no money in hands and no food to eat, I had no idea where to go. But my sister and her husband found me after a week I ran away from home. They took me to their place and said, “Thomas, you don’t be in India. We will get you a passport. Go abroad and start a new life.”&amp;nbsp; I’m still grateful to them for all those they did to me. They gave me money and sent me to Chennai to apply for passport. Medical fitness test day. I was rejected with the reason that I was affected with a disease which was the initial step for AIDS. I was so dejected. My own dad spoke ill about me, everyone around me tells the same, and now when I thought that I saw a new ray of hope it is shattered with this disease now. I knew about the disease for I was connected with Sangama organization then as I was a homosexual. Even my mom’s love wasn’t a reason enough to stop me from taking my life away. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I went to Marina beach and decided to end my life in that endless sea. With mobile in one hand and 1500 rupees in other hand, I was torn between the decision to die and live. I was stepping into the waves and backing away the next minute. That is when my sister called me and asked where I was. My family did not know the fact I was a homosexual then. So, I cannot tell them the true reason why I was rejected in the medical test too. I said, “Akka, They rejected me telling that something is wrong with my blood. I don’t like to live akka. I’m in Marina beach now to end my life. Can you hear the waves?”&amp;nbsp; I held the phone near sea for her to hear the waves. She was immediately in tears and said, “Come back Thomas. I will take care of you lifelong. But I can’t afford to lose you. Just stay with us.” Once again I dropped the idea of kicking the bucket and headed back to Bangalore.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;TORN:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Fate never stopped playing with my life. I reached Bangalore by train and was looking for an auto to go home. I spotted an auto and asked if he can take me to my place naming it. Driver readily agreed and a few others too got in. I thought it was something like share-auto. God knows what they thought about me. We were nearing our place and I asked the driver to stop. My words fell on deaf ears. He never stopped and headed to some place. I started screaming and the two people who were sitting next to me pinned me down muffling my screams. The driver stopped at a deserted place which seemed like some forest area. They were four men including the driver. They dragged me out and…. and….&amp;nbsp; They dragged me out and tore my dress away. One man inserted his penis in my anus while another stuffed my mouth with his’. Other two were also harassing. Harassing is the lighter way of describing it. I can’t even explain the pain. My anus was torn and I was bleeding. All I remember is the unbearable pain and then everything went blank. When the insatiable beasts felt that satiated, they abandoned me. I woke up to find myself in the middle of a forest lying naked on the ground with bleeding anus and terrible pain. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I couldn’t get up and there was no energy left in me even to make noise for help. I felt so disgusted and ashamed. I didn’t have the courage to go back to my sister’s place. I gathered all the energy left in my body and got up. With pain throbbing in every inch of the body and a torn anus, I went to a doctor for treatment. He saw my condition and said, “You trans-genders are like this and I can’t treat you filthy creature!” Even the government hospital did not treat me. I had been working with a dentist as an assistant. So, I knew little about medication. With no doctor to treat me, I went to a pharmacy and asked for an ointment and painkiller tablet. I gulped the tablet and applied the ointment but I was in the middle of nowhere. I had no idea of going back to my sister’s place in this condition. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I slept on the roadside living on bore water. It was four days since the horror happened and I was literally starving. Then came a fellow, to help me like a God-sent angel. He came to me and asked if I’m willing to come with him. Of course for the obvious reason: sex. I said. “I will come anywhere you call me, but please get me some food first. Just get a bun and tea and then take me anywhere.” He got me food and took me to a place. Yes, I gave him my body for his pleasure. Those monsters frayed my body abusively but this fellow got me food when I was starving. After he was done, he gave me 100 rupees for the services I provided him. At that moment those 100 rupees felt like winning some bumper prize of 1000 rupees.&amp;nbsp; &lt;br /&gt;
I decided to go back home. I didn’t tell anyone what happened. At home, I heard my sisters talking. They were talking about how remote are the chances for them to get married with no money at home. I knew I should earn and do something. But….. how do I earn? &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;RE-BORN:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
That day, for the first time, I went and looked at my reflection in the mirror. Don’t ask me if I have never looked a mirror before. You know what I mean. I looked at my reflection and imagined how I will look without beard and moustache; with long hair and clad in sari. The idea suddenly dawned on me. First, I went and shaved clean. I stole a sari, an in-skirt, a blouse and a bra. Stuffed these clothes in a bag and took 400 rupees to buy a wig. I told to my family that I’ve got an opportunity to work in a construction site and will be back in a month or two with money. They bought my story without any further questions and I walked out of home with a clear mind on what I’m going to do.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I dressed in those stolen clothes and went to a bus stop hoping that I will be convincing enough to get a customer. Already, there were few other people like me trying to hook customers. Like any community, new comers are ragged and probed with questions among us too. They approached me and asked who I am and why I was new there. I knew a few trans-genders through the Organization I was associated with and I immediately referred a trans-gender who had voice in that area. They further asked if I had attained Nirvana and when I told no, they warned me about the police and rowdy issues and asked me to be safe. With that they left to drench themselves in alcohol before satisfying some testosterone charged stranger. (A trans-gender attains Nirvana by undergoing castration operation.)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A man came and called me. He asked me how much the pay is. Honestly, I had no clue. However, I can’t lose my client. I asked, “How much are you willing to pay?” he offered 300 rupees. I got the amount and he took me to his house. In the middle of intercourse somebody came and I had to flee away. I jumped a wall and landed on thorns. Without minding the thorns and bushes I ran back to the bus stop for earning more for the night. Luckily, I got the money from him before the act. By the time I reached the stop, others were waiting for me to loot half of my collection. It’s mandatory among us to give half of the earned amount to elder trans-genders. But right now I need money for my sister’s marriage. I tucked one hundred rupee note inside the bra and lied to them that I received 200 rupees. They took away hundred from me leaving me with 200 for my current mission: get my sister married.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I saved 30,000 in a span of three months and with that money I got my sister married. She now leads a happy life in Bangalore. After that, I decided to undergo the operation and attain Nirvana. Bad times never knock the door before it comes. My surgery was over, and I had to be in bed rest for few days. Is it at this time my mom should smell something fishy and come in search of me? But that’s how life works. I had told at home that I was working with a contractor and I seldom went home. One night, my mom started searching for me in every possible place. A kind-hearted trans-gender akka called me up and told that my mom is in pursuit of me and asked me to go and meet her. She asked me to go in shirt and trouser for my mom had no clue what I was up to. I decided it was high time I told my mom. I took an auto and went to the place where my mom was searching for me. I was wearing a female night dress. She was puzzled but got into the auto. I brought her home and told her the whole truth. I lifted my dress and showed her my operated genitals. She cried the way she would have had her son died. She said, “I gave birth to a son! What have you done to yourself? In what way, did I spare you my love and affection? Why did you have to do this?” I consoled her telling, “Amma.. This is what I’m. It’s okay. You gave birth to a son but now you have daughter. Only that has changed. Never will my love change for you.” With that I couldn’t control my sobs. I lied on my mom’s lap and cried my heart out.&amp;nbsp; After convincing her, I gave her some money and bid her farewell. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;LOST:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
From then on, my routine was: go to shops and collect money; do sex-work; give half as per the untold rule; send home as much money as possible. Sounds like where we can put ‘the end’ and say life went on like that ever after. Those things happen only in tales and movies. Real life is pretty nasty and doesn’t seem fair at all the time. Or to put it this way, I think God thought my life is getting settled and I’m at little peace. When I thought, I had nothing more to lose in my life and accepted the way it is, came a blow which made me realize the value of the precious thing I was in possession of. I had nothing valuable other than my mom. I lost her to the fate of death.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It was my birthday. I never realized. I was in bed with a customer when my mom called me on my mobile. I picked up and she asked if I remember what day it was. I had no idea and asked her what. She said, “It is your birthday honey! Happy birthday! Go to church and offer your token to God.” I thanked her for the wish with blinking away those swelling tear beads. And that was the last time I heard my mom’s voice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Exactly 30 days after her wish, my sister called me up telling, “Our mom is in serious condition! Our dad has beaten her to death. Hurry up to Pondicherry general hospital.” I felt: my world is doomed. I later came to know what had happened. My mom had found 1000 rupees missing in the routine monthly amount I send home. She had enquired with my sisters and found the mystery of missing money wasn’t solved. However, it was solved shortly after the arrival of my dad. He was completely intoxicated. The capital for that intoxication was those 1000 bucks. My mom had started crying and between her sobs she has asked, “Rosy is earning money by selling her body just to feed us and how shamelessly you flick that amount and drink! Don’t you have a heart?” That was all needed to agitate my dad. One slap! And there she was profusely bleeding hitting a stone in the head. The monster from whose loins I came didn’t stop there. He wasn’t drunk till his throat but was completely drowned that he couldn’t even realize that my mom was semi-conscious and was bleeding. He has said, “If you don’t get up now I’m going to kill you.” When she didn’t get up- of course, she was semi-conscious by then unable to move- he took a rock and smashed my mom’s head. &lt;br /&gt;
Sisters had rushed her to the hospital and there she was lying critically ill. I hurried to hospital.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the way, I had to cross a beach. There, a man signaled me and asked for my rate. I said, “Already am in agony, don’t trespass me now. Let me go in peace.” But he was so determined that he stalked me and abducted me to a lonely place. Needless to say, my anus was torn once again. When he was done with me, I couldn’t afford to take time to rest for it was my MOM who was there in hospital. I again called my sister to ask for the exact details and she told that it was another hospital. I caught an auto and rushed up there to find my mom tied to the cot handles. Doctors told that she was getting fits and to prevent that they had tied her hands and legs to the cot. So long she hadn’t responded to anyone’s voice. But at the instance of my voice mom opened her eyes and tears were flowing down cheeks.&amp;nbsp; Not just in her cheeks in mine too. Generally I call my mom old’ granny. I started calling out to her, “Hey granny get up! I have come and how dare you sleep! Are you getting up or shall I leave?” No reaction. A nurse came with a glass of milk. I got it from her and fed a few spoons to my mom. And lo! She was gone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I started drinking everyday from then on. My only precious thing was gone and what else do I have in life to lose anymore? But bad times never come alone. The guru, with whom I was staying, chased me out of home looting till the last penny I had. They didn’t stop there. Before turning me out, she along with a few others tortured me physically by burning my skin, slitting open my back skin and lots more which can’t be said in words. Now I’m with no place to shelter my head and no penny in pocket. Remember the sister whom I got married by saving money? I went to her place seeking asylum but all I got was a cold return. My sister’s husband chased me out the way one does a stray dog. Dejected than ever and also with no roof above my head I started travelling in train from Mysore to Bangalore every day. Sometimes I go to Marina beach spend some time and come back. Now, I’m saving money little by little for rent advance and a house owner has given me a word that he will rent his place for me. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;THE WAY AHEAD:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This is for my past and present. Now for the future: I adopted a baby girl. She is five months old now. I got her from a prostitute. She gave birth to this girl and was not in a condition to look after her. There is no law for people like us to adopt children. They say it’s unsafe and we cannot to take care of them. But what do they know about our motherhood?. We can take care of kids better than many women. As I cannot adopt the baby legally, I bought her for five thousand rupees. I’m homeless right now and I know that she won’t be fine in my hands for now. I have left her with a sister in Pondicherry church. Every month I send 1000 rupees to sister to take care of my girl. Also, remember about a sister of mine who is affected with brain fever. All I want to do is take care of these two souls as much as I can. When my baby turns a year old, I will bring her here and keep her with myself and will bring her up.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I would like to become a dentist. I’m ready to do any business other than sex-work to earn a livelihood. I know 5 languages. If not dentist then I would like to work in BPO. I love that job. I’m not literate or anything to speak big and polished. But I can tell what my heart yearns for. I want to be treated as an equal human being in the society. I don’t want sympathy or generosity from anyone. Please, do not give us a dirty look as if looking at filth and move away in disgust. We are nature’s choice just like a man and woman. Just give us equal opportunity and we will take care of ourselves. We are humans and are entitled every human right like anyone else. Please do not change your seat in the bus if you find a trans-gender sitting next to you. Do not mock at us or call names in public for even we have a heart which beats in the name of love and dies at every hostile look.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I became a die-hard fan of Robin Sharma after reading his book "&lt;a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2011/12/monk-who-sold-his-ferrari-book-review.html" target="_blank"&gt;The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari&lt;/a&gt;". I pre-ordered this book and was very excited to read his latest book. This book follows the same pattern as his earlier books (i.e) blend the life teachings in an interesting story. I could see a big difference. This book is more of a story which explains the teachings than the teachings explicitly. Each portion of the story comes with a summary. The story goes like this...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Jonathan Laundry is a hardworking automobile designer who struggles to find a balance between his work life and personal life. He is separated from his wife Annisha and his son Adam. His life is in turmoil. Suddenly, his mom forces him to meet Julian Mantle, his cousin and the hero of the previous book. Julian makes him travel around the world to the sensual tango halls of Buenos Aires, the haunting catacombs of Paris, the gleaming towers of Shanghai and the staggeringly beautiful Taj Mahal in India and meet his friends to collect the talismans. Each talisman and the encounter with Julian's friends teach him the life lessons that is very much needed for him to save his family and become successful in his life. Here is a gist of the teachings...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Power of Authenticity&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The most important gift we can give ourselves is the commitment to living our authentic life.We must break free of the seductions of society and live life on our own terms, under our own values and aligned with our original dreams.We must explore the deep-seated, unseen hopes, desires, strengths and weaknesses that make us who we are. Every decision we make, every step we take, must be informed by our commitment to living a life that is true and&amp;nbsp;honest&amp;nbsp;and authentic to ourselves and ourselves alone. As we proceed, we are certain to experience fortune well beyond our highest imagination.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Embrace Your Fears&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The greatest risk in life is taking no risks. But every time we do that which we fear, we take back the power that fear has stolen from us - for on the other side of our fears lives our strength. Every time we step into the discomfort of growth and progress, we become more free. The more fears we walk through, the more powers we reclaim. In this way, we grow both fearless and powerful, and thus are able to live the lives of our dreams.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Live with Kindness&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;No action, no matter how small, is insignificant - how we treat someone defines, how we treat everyone, including ourselves. If we cant appreciate those around us, we cant appreciate ourselves. With every person we engage, in everything we do, we must be kinder than expected, more generous than anticipated, more positive than we thought possible. Every moment in front of another human being is a chance to express our highest value and to influence someone with our humanity. We can make the world better, one person at a time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Make Small Daily Progress&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The way we do small things determine the way we do everything. If we execute our minor tasks well, we will excel at our larger efforts as well. Each tiny effort builds on the next, so that brick by brick,&amp;nbsp;magnificent things can be created, great confidence grows and uncommon dreams are realized.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;To Lead Your Best Life, Do Your Best Work&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; There is no insignificant work in this world. All&amp;nbsp;labor&amp;nbsp;is a chance to express our personal talents, to create our art and to realize the genius we are meant to be. We must work like Picasso painted: with devotion, passion, energy and excellence. In this way, our productivity will not only become a source of inspiration to others, but it will have an impact - making a difference in the lives around us. One of the greatest secrets to a life beautifully lived is to do work that matters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Choose Your Influences Well&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; We must always be aware of the things and people we allow in to our lives. Its a mark of wisdom to choose to spend time in the places that inspire an energize you and to associate with those people who elevate you and uplift you. Weather in our work or within our personal lives, these most positive friends and peers will inspire us to be our greatest self and lead our largest lives.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Life's Simplest Pleasures are Life's Greatest Joys&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Most people&amp;nbsp;don't&amp;nbsp;discovers whats more important in their lives until they are too old to do anything about it. They spend many of their best years pursuing things that matter little in the end. While society invites us to fill our lives with material objects, the best part of us knows that the most basic pleasures are the one that enrich us. We all have a wealth of simple blessings around us - waiting to be counted. &amp;nbsp;As we do, our happiness grows. Our gratitude expands. And each day becomes a breath taking gift.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Purpose of Life is to Love&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; How well you live come down to how much you love. The heart is wiser than your head. Honor it. Trust it. Follow it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Stand for Something Bigger than Yourself&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; There are no extra people alive today. Every single one of us are here for a reason, a special purpose - a mission. Yes, build a beautiful life for yourself and those you love.Yes, be happy and have a lot of fun. And yes, become successful on your own terms than on those suggested to you by society. But, above all else - Be Significant. Make your life matter - be of use. And be of service to as many people as possible. This is how each of us can shift from the realm of the ordinary to the heights of the extraordinary. And walk among the best who have ever lived.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I just wrote down the key messages from the book in Robin Sharma's words. I would suggest you to read the book. These message will go into your&amp;nbsp;subconscious mind directly. Jesus understood the importance of stories, so does Robin. Thank you Robin, for this book and all the books&amp;nbsp;that you are going to write in future.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
I knew Bob Proctor from the movie "&lt;i&gt;The Secret&lt;/i&gt;" way back in 2008. I have watched lot of his videos and interviews in the internet. He has 40+ years of experience in motivating others to reach their goals and accumulate abundant wealth. I happened to see this book in the new book store opened next to my office and I grabbed this book as soon as I saw Bob's name in it. This is the first book from Bob that I read.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book has two parts. The first part "&lt;i&gt;Become A Magnet To Money&lt;/i&gt;" is by Bob who tells us the tips and techniques to attract more money into our lives. The second part "&lt;i&gt;The Sea Of Unlimited Consciousness&lt;/i&gt;" is by Michelle Blood who gives guidance to all which you may be feeling, as you rise higher into Oneness with Divine Consciousness. The second part of the book was beyond my comprehension of Divine Consciousness, so could not enjoy or benefit from that. I am supposed to feel rejuvenated after reading the complete material on Unlimited Consciousness, but I felt blank. However, the first part by Bob Proctor was very interesting and informative that I even started to work out few things, which I would not have done otherwise. Once you are done reading the book, I would suggest listening to the Audio CD that comes along. Things will make deeper sense, the second time. Here is a gist of some of the concepts explained in the book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Invariably every teacher on Motivational/Transformational Training tells us the relationship between being happy and having abundant wealth. You can start with nothing, but you need to be happy and be in that mental state, most of the time.  Just by being in that vibration and taking simple actions towards your goal of accumulating abundant wealth, anyone can become who they want to become. The first and foremost thing is “Be Happy and Grateful”.
Other than the usual motivational/feelings/vibration based discussions, this book packs some practical tips to tune your mind to achieve financial freedom. Some are...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Multiple Sources of Income (MSI):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; What ever work that you are doing right now is your Primary Source of Income (PSI). If your PSI is something that you love to do, please continue doing that job. Else, look for some job which gives more meaning to you and your life. PSI is where you need to be present (i.e. Need your time or physical presence).  
MSI is other alternative sources which gives you an income, but doesn’t require your constant intervention. It could be the royalty from the books, photography or art, rental income, income from investments, advertisement income from your website, income from selling products online etc.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Please, please do not let your inner voice say, “Hey, that’s not for me. I am not going to sell soaps for an income. I do have my own values to live by”.  Even I was under the influence of this thought, when I first read this chapter. You may not have MSI right now or do not see any real possibility of having one or more in near future. The BIG idea is to open up your mind to the possibility of having MSI. Just don’t fix your mind ONLY on PSI. When your mind is open for MSI, you will automatically start looking for options within the limits of your own value system. Almost every millionaire/billionaire in this world has MSIs. Great Idea!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Law of Relativity &amp;amp; Income Acceleration:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; I absolutely love this Idea, Read on. Find a comfortable, quiet place where you won’t be disturbed for few hours and grab a pen, paper and a calculator. Play this game. Think about a ridiculously huge amount (I’d say $5 million) and decide that you are going to earn that amount in 12 months. Think about MSIs. Take this seriously to your heart and try to solve this puzzle, little by little. Think seriously that you have to earn this money and think about the possible ways available to you. Do this once every week religiously for few weeks. You might not have got any solutions/ideas after few weeks. But you are creating your future inside your mind. After few weeks of doing this exercise, you may lower the amount to say $3 million. This time, $3 million won’t feel like a huge amount to you. Your mind will think that it’s relatively easy to earn $3 million. Wow… Your mind is tuned into Income Acceleration mode. You are gaining prosperity consciousness. This is the Law of Relativity.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Daily Action List:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; "&lt;i&gt;Goals without actions stay as dreams and never materialize&lt;/i&gt;". By this time, you would have finalized your goals. Just break down your goals into smallest possible unit of work which can be done in a day or even in a minute. Write them down in your Daily Action List and do one task in a day. It’s, just that simple. But do these continuously for 30 days and it will become your habit.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; A sample daily action list could be like… 
"&lt;i&gt;I will create a website of my streaming videos, explaining the products and services that my company offers&lt;/i&gt;". This is a goal. The Daily Action List could be. "&lt;i&gt;1. Buy a Domain Name. 2. Buy hosting space. 3. Research for a web designer 4. Get a good picture of me for the home page. 5. Get a good video camera. 6. Learn how to take good videos. 7. Shoot the video etc&lt;/i&gt;". The idea is to make sure that one action can be completed comfortably in a day. Before you realize, you would have accomplished more that what you would have done without Daily Action List.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These are just a glimpse of what this book has to offer. If you are interested in abundant wealth, make this book your constant companion. You can get a copy of this book by clicking the below links.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;ISBN-13:&lt;/b&gt; 9789381626276,978-9381626276&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Binding:&lt;/b&gt; Paperback&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Publishing Date:&lt;/b&gt; 2011&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
India is a place where still uttering words like ‘infidelity’ will make people roll their eyes. Affairs- irrespective of being extra-marital or pre-marital are a taboo to be talked upon. Even if someone sees you reading a book on anything to do with relationship, you will be seen as a person with some different morale. As much as we portray ourselves as very civilized and traditional group, so much of affairs keep happening around us. Every now and then a scandal or rumor arises about affairs. But as long as it doesn’t happen to us or people in our close circle, we tend to look at it as information or a juicy chunk of gossip. These affairs carry with it a lot of assumptions and myths. The very cover of the book shatters the ever told myth: “It’s common that men stray”. But who do they have affair with? I told myself, “Okay, that’s a point.”&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All of us tend to believe that infidelity or affair could happen only for others. Mine is a perfect relationship. But even those who face the infidelity think the same before discovering it. The point is: It might happen in any relationship or marriage. Vijay has artfully put this book together. I would call it ‘A-Z infidelity’. He has begun with how monogamy is a discipline we follow and not the nature of our species, connecting to the infidelity in history and its changes in the modern times. Another myth proven wrong is: ‘affairs are those when physical relationship involves’. Author has penned the various types of affairs and the driving factors behind them. For example, even emotional intimacy with opposite gender other than your spouse which detracts your marriage qualifies as an affair.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The casual tone and stating things matter-of-fact drives home the point hitting the bull’s eye. The five hall-marks of an affair stated by Vijay would definitely make ourselves think if we are having any affair unconsciously. The book is divided into two parts: Understanding infidelity and Surviving infidelity. Time and again, Vijay keeps insisting the point: “An affair happens because a person chooses so. The counter-part is not responsible for an affair by being unattractive or any such reason.” Even perfect and happy marriages stumble upon infidelity. Apt stories illustrate every little nuance which the author tries to tell.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While the first half of book analyses infidelity, second half tells you how to survive through it and emerge out successfully. ‘It happened, now how do I handle it and come out of it without throwing a tantrum’- is what the book tries to tell you. The book analyses from both the partners’ perspective without imaging anyone as villain. Taking a neutral stand, it advises both the parties the most advisable course of actions to follow. The focal point of the book is how far it is possible to revive the marriage or the relationship after the catastrophe ‘infidelity’ happens.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is not a novel or a story to criticize from literary perspective analyzing the metaphors and personifications. Definite applauds for the articulation of the rich and heavy content. Being the third book in the series ‘The New Indian Marriage’ and the first I read, there are many references to the other books in the series as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Guess I might write this review as big as a book in an attempt to pen down my thought flow. I would recommend this book to anyone irrespective of being in relationship or not, or for that matter married or not. Whichever category you fall in, this book is going to serve you as guide on how to react and live through the trauma of infidelity. Or unfortunately, if you have already faced one then it is going to alter most of your perceptions about affairs and break a few myths which you are clinging to. And hey, wait! Do not think that you will start suspecting your partner after reading this book. It is just going to make you bond more to him/her. In author’s words: “Trust your partner, and more than that trust yourself.”&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Language:&lt;/b&gt; English&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is the first book I read in Chicken Soup series. The title ‘A book of miracles’ made me raise eye brows, wondering what I could expect in this book. The excerpt at back cover confirmed my guess that it’s superficial yet true incidents that happened in people’s life. Though the secret was revealed, my curiosity took over me and I found myself reading the book ardently.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes you meet someone somewhere and the incident seems to have happened before. And you wonder how it is possible. You try to tell this to your friends and most of the times you get skeptic looks and mock laughs behind the back. Well, I’m a person who has experienced those. Though I have a different rationale for the miracles and coincidences, I do believe that MIRACLES DO HAPPEN IN LIFE.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The very first story ‘Angelic presence’ by Seema Agarwal gave me a slight shiver. Though many of the stories are so similar to the ones which we have heard in our early days, each story never fails to widen your eyes or even make your heart skip a beat (If ardent believer in religion). And the fact that these stories being real life incidents ignited a debate between my mind and heart for many of these couldn’t be explained in the present scientific terms. Stories have been compiled and sorted under same kind and presented with an anecdote in the beginning of every part.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Modern day scientists and psychiatrists may give rational explanations for many of the events which will make most of the atheists to nod their heads in approval. But there are a few occurrences which transcend all the human rationale. No ‘mind over matter’ like theories can explain those. There are a few stories which hit me like hitting the bull’s eye.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Signs from above&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Angelic presence&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The tacky label&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Love from beyond&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Basanti and Veeru2. Little Molly&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;His saving grace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mamma, the wind carried me safe&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Answered prayers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Mehr&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyday miracles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My top five miracles&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The miracle called Laska&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Divine appointment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The call of Kathak&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The magic of faith&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paint a picture of your dreams&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
These ten stories stand apart and really touched my heart. You can reason many of the incidents in these stories. So what? If something from within makes things possible, name it as you like it. Let it be your own will power or faith or karma or some angelic help.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Literary critic is a little difficult with respect to this particular book because it’s not penned by just one author. Simple language and brevity are the two great plus points, I would say. Even beginners in reading wouldn’t find it difficult to read. However, I came across a few difficulties. Some of the stories narrators haven’t identified themselves properly in the beginning. Couldn’t make out if the narrator is male or female in many of the instances. Either had to turn the page to find the name at the end of the story or look for any hints of self-identification in the story. It was a little disturbing and interrupted the flow. Also, I felt certain stories were categorized under a different category while it seemed to belong under a different category.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book might be a really a book of miracles for those who really believe in a supreme power while might make the agnostics scratch their chins with skepticism. And for those trying to take a double stand, this book definitely has the potential to convince you to turn a believer of miracles. You can find conviction and genuineness in all the 101 stories. I would conclude that any event and every event in life is a miracle, for I consider: “Life itself is a MIRACLE.”&lt;br /&gt;

"&lt;i&gt;When the student is ready, the teacher appears&lt;/i&gt;". Sounds superficial?. Not to me. This book was released 14 years ago and I saw this book in every book store, everyone told me that this book is awesome, but some how this book eluded me, even though I wanted to read it. I did not bother much then. In recent days, my life was not happening as I wanted it to happen. Everything was out of my control and I wanted to discipline my life. Viola... The book appears next to my bed. My room mate bought the book. So, I started reading...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you want me to write one line review, I would say, "One the best books that I have read so far".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This is a self help book written like a novel. The story is so well written that you don't even feel like someone is teaching you something. Every tip that he gives, go to your sub-conscious mind without any effort. I even wondered how can so much of practical wisdom could be packed into a single book.Robin Sharma shares his wisdom with a mystical fable of a uber-successful lawyer Julian Mantle and his assitant John. Julian Mantle is the hot shot millionaire lawyer in the country. During his middle age, in one of the courtroom arguments, he gets a massive heart attack. He suddenly realizes that he has more life to live and there must be a reason for his existence. He leaves to Himalayas learns the tricks of life and comes back to US to spread the wisdom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Here is a gist of what he teaches in the book. I would suggest you read the complete book in Robin Sharma's words. He explains the seven virtues of life with a simple tale. Each character and object in the mystical fable has a meaning.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
&lt;i&gt;You are sitting in the middle of a magnificient, lush, green garden. This garden is filled with the most spectacular flowers you have ever seen. The environment is supremely tranquil and silent. In the center of this garden stands a towering red light house, six stories high. Suddenly from the light house, comes out a nine-foot tall, nine-hundred pound Japanese Sumo wreslter who casually wanders into the garden.He wears nothing but a pink wire cable covering his private parts. He slips on a shily gold stopwatch, and falls to the ground with an enormous thud. The Sumo wreslter is rendered&amp;nbsp;unconscious&amp;nbsp;and lies there, silent and still. After a while, he awakens by the fragrance of the fresh yellow roses blooming nearby. Through the bushes at the very edge of the garden, he observes a long winding path covered by millions of sparkling diamonds. This path leads him down the road of ever lasting joy and eternal bliss.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1. Master Your Mind:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The garden in the fable represents your mind. Like the fresh, frangrant roses in the garden, fill your mind with pleasant, happy and positive thoughts. Good gardeners don't allow the weeds to take root in their garden. So, do not allow any negative thoughts to wander in your mind. You cannot afford the luxury of even a single thought. He gives some techniques to do that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Heart of the Rose:&lt;/b&gt; Pick up a fresh rose flower or a plastic one in your hand in the morning as soon as you wake. Just look at the flower, its color, its petal, its curves. Just enjoy the flower and do nothing. Initially your mind wont let you do that. It will wander into all possible directions. Do not worry. Just follow the ritual for 15 minutes or more daily. Slowly you will be able to calm down the mind. You can choose alternatives like meditation or chanting any mantras. The idea here is to spend sometime for yourself to calm down the mind in the morning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Opposition Thinking:&lt;/b&gt; Whenever a negative thought appears in your mind, just pause for a while and replace it with a opposite positive thoughts. For example, if you begin to think about your current debts, suddenly change your thought to something like you have more than enough money for everything you want. Initially you may feel awkward. Do not mind. Just let your imagination fly. Slowly, you will begin to notice that there are no negative thoughts and you start taking positive actions. You need to do this all the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Secret of the Lake:&lt;/b&gt; Everyone should have goals. If you dont have one in your life, sit down and think about it. One you are sure about your goals, you need to find a calm place to sit and visualize in your mind screen a movie, in which all your goals are achieved and you are experiencing eternal joy. I do it differently. As soon asI finish meditation, I close my eyes with my palms and I see nothing but darkness. I visualize my goals as a movie in that dark screen. Try !&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;2. Follow Your Purpose:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The light house in the fable represents your purpose in life. You will never be able to hit a target that you cannot see. So, figure out your goals. WRITE them down in a paper. When you do that you send a flag to your mind that these thoughts are far more important than the other 60,000 thoughts. Your mind will become acutely aware about your goals and start realizing it. This is science. You can follow the below five steps.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Picturize the outcome:&lt;/b&gt; If you have a goal to lose weight, picturize the outcome of it. Picturize yourself being lean and fit. Do this every morning as soon as you wake up. You set the motion for the rest of your day with this visualization.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Create Positive Pressure:&lt;/b&gt; Public pledge is one the best positive pressure for humans. Tell everyone about your goals. They will be watching you. No one wants to appear as failure among others. This positive pressure will help you to keep up with your plans for achieving your goals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Attach a timeline:&lt;/b&gt; To breathe life into your goals, attach a timeline to your goals. A goal that is not committed to paper is no goal at al. Buy a notebook and call that your "Dream Book". Fill tha book with your goals, desires, acheivements and the things that you want to improve. Get to know about yourself completely. Fill that book with the images of all the things that want to have or to be. Refer this book everyday.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Magic Rule of 21:&lt;/b&gt; For a new process to install as a habit, you need to do that consequtively for 21 days. This is proven by many people over years. So, keep doing the above for 21 continous days and viola it will be a habit.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Enjoy the journey:&lt;/b&gt; Do not fix your eyes on the destination only. Enjoy the route to your destination. Enjoy every happiness that you can while you are practizing the above.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;3. Practice Kaizen:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The Japanese word Kaizen means constant and never ending improvement. The sumo wrestler symbolizes the constant self-improvement and personal expansion. People grow the most when they enter the Zone of the Unknown. He urges us to do the things that we fear and suggests 10 ancient rituals for radiant living. Just follow these rituals for 30 days and your life will begin to change drastically. Here are they.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ritual of Solitute:&lt;/b&gt; Ensure that your daily schedule includes a mandatory period of peace. Find a quiet and beautiful place to sit still in contemplation. You could do the heart of the rose technique or any other kind of meditation. The place could be a spare room inyour house, or a corner in your apartment or a natural backyard. Please make sure that you do this daily at the same time and at the same place, till it becomes a habit. Just by doing this simple ritual, your life will well balanced and you will enjoy good sleep at night. Guys - trust me. It works. I do this everyday, first thing in the morning. Please try.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ritual of Physicality:&lt;/b&gt; This says as you care for your body, so you care for your mind. Please take some time everyday to nourish your body with physical exercise. It could be weight training, aerobic training or yoga or simple walk around the park. Choose whichever is comfirtable for you, but persist. At least 5 hours a week is suggested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ritual of Live Nourishment:&lt;/b&gt; Eat live foods. Foods that are not dead. He suggests vegetarian foods like fresh fruits, vegetables, grains etc. It may not be possible for everyone, but we could add few fruits or salads with each meal. I am finding it very difficult to eat vegetarian food, but started eating fruits after lunch. Did not see much improvement, but I could feel hungry before dinner. Otherwise, I will be full all the time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ritual of Abundant Knowledge:&lt;/b&gt; This centers on the whole notion of lifelong learning and expanding your knowledge base for the benefit of yourself and those around you. Read atleast 30 minutes a day. It wil do wonders in your life. I know this very well. I read about an hour a day. Solutions to almost every problem is already in print. Just grab a good book and start reading.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ritual of Personal Reflection:&lt;/b&gt; Spend some time on personal introspection every evening or night. Just sit down in a silent place and write down all the actions that you did on that day and think if those activities are positive or negative. If negative, come up with an alternative course of action to correct it. Initially you may not be able to recall every event in that day. But persist. Eventually you will be able to and your behaviour would turn positive and optimistic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ritual of Early Awakening:&lt;/b&gt; Rise with the sun. Taught by almost all the self help gurus. The thoughts you think, 10 minutes before you sleep and 10 minutes after you wake up have a prfound effect on your day. So, think nice and happy thoughts. Laugh even if you dont feel like. Listen to music. Watch the sun rise. Read a good book. Prepare your course of action for the rest of the day. You can achieve so much, just by this ritual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ritual of Music:&lt;/b&gt; Music has the capability to soothen the raffled soul. Its one of the finest motivators. Enjoy the music you like, atleast once in a day.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ritual of Spoken Word:&lt;/b&gt; You can choose any mantra or positive affirmation to recite in the morning, noon and night or whenever you feel drowned in negative thoughts. Spoken affirmations are as good as written ones. You may say. "I am strong, able and calm" many times when you need to be.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ritual of Radiant Living:&lt;/b&gt; This ritual requires you to take daily, incremental action to build your character. You should have a set of principles/virtues to live by and take daily action to strengthen your character aligned with those principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ritual of Simplicity:&lt;/b&gt; This ritual requires you to live a simple life. Focus only on your priorities, those activities that are truly meaningful. Your life will be uncluttered, rewarding and exceptionally peaceful. This doesn't mean that you should not strive to be rich and wealthy. If that is what you want, go for it. Make sure that you spend time on actions which tops your priority list and close to your heart. Don't just chase money.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;4. Power of discipline:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The pink wire cable which covers the private parts of the Japanese Sumo wrestler symbolizes the discipline, self control that you should have in your life. Robin says, "When you control your thoughts, you control your mind. When you control your mind, you controlyour life. Once you reach the stage of being in total control of your life, you become the master of your destiny". You slowly nurture the embryo of self discipline day by day and one day you will have enormous will power to do the things that seem impossible.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mantras:&lt;/b&gt; Robin stresses again on the importance of mantras/affirmations that keeps us focused on our true goals. Words have power. By repetition, you would develop self-control and indomitable will within a short period of time. The same is referred as the Ritual of Spoken Word in the previous chapter.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Vow of Silence:&lt;/b&gt; He suggests us to go on an entire day without speaking, except for the answers to the direct questions. Whenever you feel the urge to speak, suppress it. It will help to improve your will power. Somehow, I dont buy into that concept. I am not going to try this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;5. Respect Your Time:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The shiny gold stopwatch symbolizes your time, the most precious commodity. "Being an excellent time manager doesnt mean that you have to become a workaholic. On the contrary, time mastery allows more time to do the things that you would love to do and the things which are meaningful to you. Time mastery leads to life mastery. Guard your time well. Remember, its a non renewable resource". Some of the things that you may do are&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Ancient Rule of 20:&lt;/b&gt; The statistics say that 80% of your success comes from the 20% of the action that you take. So, prioritize the things and spend more time on the things that bring you success and happiness. Just&amp;nbsp;don't&amp;nbsp;be busy being busy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Learn to say NO:&lt;/b&gt; Many people drift from their goals or distracted by others very often. Learning to say NO to the less important things in life, allows you to spend more time on the things that trylu matters. Don't pick up all the calls. Dont respond toevery emails. Few other practical stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Deathbed Mentality:&lt;/b&gt; I have heard this from Steve Jobs as well. "What would you do, if this is your last day in your life?" Ask this question every morning and let it decide the course of action for the entire day. I am personally not into this. If today was my last day, I would spend all the time with my love, family and friends, roam around, enjoy and have fun. I would never think about work. Is that what he suggests? I don't think so. Also, I would n't prefer to think about death every morning.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;6. Selflessly Serve Others:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The fresh yellow roses in the garden symbolizes the most essential virtue of an enlightened living - Serving others. "The quality of your life will come down to the quality of your contribution". When you work to improve the lives of others, you indirectly elevating the life of yours. He suggests few tips to start serving others.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Random Acts of Kindness:&lt;/b&gt; Just make sure that you do few kind actions through out your day. It could be helping the old woman cross the street, helping your&amp;nbsp;colleague&amp;nbsp;with a small problem, simple appreciation to a friend in need or just flashing a smile across a stranger. Just keep doing it. When you do the ritual of personal&amp;nbsp;reflection, these random acts of kindness will soothe your soul and in no time, you will become a kind person doing big things for the society.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Give to those who Ask:&lt;/b&gt; How many times in your life, that someone came to you for help and you were too busy to help them?. I get the point that it is not possible to help everyone else all the time. But, whenever possible take extra few minutes to help them. They will never forget your help.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Cultivate Richer Relationships:&lt;/b&gt; Should I even describe about this technique?. Develop richer relationship with friends and family. It doesn't matter how many friends you have in life, what matters is how many of them are true &amp;amp; rich relationship with whom you can have a belly-bursting laugh at some times for no reason. Go for it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;7. Embrace the Present:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;The long winding path studded with millions of diamonds represents the final virtue of the fable. Living the Present.Happiness is the journey, not the destination. Some of the things to remember are&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Live your children's childhood:&lt;/b&gt; The best gift you could ever give your children is your love. Show them that they are far more important than anything else in your life. Within a blink of eye, they will grow up, start their own family and leave. But then, it will be too late. One of the most precious moments in anyone's life is the time they spend with their children. Don't miss it for anything.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Practice Gratitude:&lt;/b&gt; Be grateful for all the small things that you have in life. Even if you are bankrupt, you can be grateful for being alive, being able to think and read. When you are in a grateful mood, you mind becomes very positive and optimistic and you start doing positive actions which would bring you success in whatever you desire.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
I felt like writing an entire book, for writing just this review. Whooh. This is not just a book review, but a book-let version - for those who doesn't have the time to read. I will come back to this blog post often to remind me all the virtues. Some books are meant to be read again and again. This is one of them. Get your copy and start reading !&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
"I Have A Dream" is the third book in Rashmi Bansal's very successful trilogy of "Stay Hungry Stay Foolish" and "&lt;a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2010/07/connect-dots.html" target="_blank"&gt;Connect The Dots&lt;/a&gt;". All the three books were sold over 350,000 copies in India and translated into 8 languages. She secured a place for her in infibeam's list of &lt;a href="http://www.infibeam.com/Books/indian-authors-writers-a.html" target="_blank"&gt;Famous Authors in India&lt;/a&gt;. Congrats to her. In my last review about "&lt;a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2010/07/connect-dots.html" target="_blank"&gt;Connect The Dots&lt;/a&gt;" book, I suggested her NOT to mix Hindi and English in the English version of the book, so that the book could inspire millions of Indians who doesn't understand Hindi. But, the same continued in this book as well. Many of my North Indian friends told me that the mix of Hindi gives them the feel of locality and connection with the person, when reading. What about me who doesn't understand Hindi?. - Its irritating. I generally do not skip even a single line, while reading any book. But this trilogy from Rashmi Bansal is the exception.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What do we have in this book, this time?. The inspiring story of 20 social entrepreneurs who took up a social cause and made a business out of it. Their motive is not to earn more money, but to make a difference in the lives of people around them. Most of them started small, without knowing their destination or a definite business plan. All they had in mind is to help the people. Eventually people, money and resources fell in place and they made it big. The surprising fact is that all of them are middle-class people, the average&amp;nbsp;Indians. If they can do it, anyone of us can also do it. All we need is the patience and&amp;nbsp;perseverance.&amp;nbsp;This is a different version of the &lt;a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2011/07/creative-capitalism-conversation-with.html" target="_blank"&gt;Creative Capitalism&lt;/a&gt; - defined by Bill Gates. The large corporations should come forward to assist one of these social organisation as their means of doing good&amp;nbsp;to the society.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is divided in to three categories, as usual.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Rainmakers:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Social enterprises which generates revenue. A new model of doing good, not mere charity. This includes a wide variety of entrepreneurs taking up a wide range of social issues. Bindeshwar Pathak - "Sulabh International" who revolutionized the sanitary situation in India, Saloni Malhotra - "DesiCrew" who setup the India's first rural BPO, Dinabandhu Sahoo - "Project Chilika" who trains the villagers in Orissa to farm the Ocean, sowing the seeds of a 'Blue Revolution', Anand Kumar - "Super 30" who coaches the poor but&amp;nbsp;meritorious students for IIT JEE &amp;nbsp;and Dhruv Lakra - "Mirakle Couriers" who believed in the most neglected portion of the society - the deaf. There are many other inspiring stories, some of which will even make you to cry.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Changemakers:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Those who cannot just accept what is wrong and make every possible step to change the way the society functions. Anshu Gupta - "Goonj" which systematically collect, sort and deliver every scrap of waste clothing from Urban India to someone out there, to wear with pride and dignity, Trilochan Sastry - "Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR)" who raised a PIL and made the&amp;nbsp;politicians&amp;nbsp;to declare their assets, criminal history during elections and continues with further reforms, Arvind Kejriwal - "Parivarthan" who is an IRS officer, but secretly started a war against his own department and teaches the people to use RTI to the fullest, Bushan Punani - "Blind People's Association (BPA)" who is an MBA from IIM, but decided to see if management&amp;nbsp;principles&amp;nbsp;could be applied to the social sectors and create a change, which he did with BPA.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Spiritual Capitalists:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; These are highly educated guys from IIT's and IIM's who felt that the service to others and the purity of the self is the way to&amp;nbsp;achieve&amp;nbsp;eternal liberation from this cycle of birth and death, thus renounced their material world. With the strong education background, they redefined the way service is done. Vinayak Lohani - "Parivaar Ashram" - a residential facility for orphans, tribals and the daughters of prostitutes. Madhu Pandit Dasa - "Akshaya Patra" from ISKON Bangalore who feeds one million hungry children every day, in and around bangalore. I met Madhu Pandit Dasa in one of the bloggers meet happened in&amp;nbsp;Bangalore. I am so happy to read his story and felt the connection with him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I would say Rashmi Bansal is one of the smartest female in the world, who created herself a chance to interview all those successful people in India. I suspect her next book, would go way beyond India. She would collect the inspiring stories around the world, not just who made it big, but those who made a small difference in a big way. We already have Rashmi Bansal's series competing with "Chicken soup for the soul" series. To make it big, impact millions around the world and to make a real difference beyond the boundary lines, she must go International. But again - No local language please !!!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;b&gt;November 22, 2011&lt;/b&gt; : Today, I decided to blog about all the irregularities that I see around me and take action against it. I will keep updating the blog, if anything productive happens after that. Here is the first one with BMTC (Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was travelling from Coimbatore to Bangalore on 22-Nov-2011 and got down at Silk Board Bus Stop. I need to catch a local bus from Silk Board to Marathahalli. I generally prefer to travel by Volvo buses only. But there was none at the time. At early morning 5 AM, with such a chill climate, I decided to hop onto the local bus.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Bus No:&lt;/b&gt; D5 (Banashankari to Hebbal)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Boarded On:&lt;/b&gt; Silk Board&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Got down At:&lt;/b&gt; Marathahalli Bridge&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Time:&lt;/b&gt; 22-Nov-2011 05:19:52 IST&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Complaint:&lt;/b&gt; Ticket was not given, unless I asked for it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-y2wIKuf62hw/TssA6W4Ll9I/AAAAAAAARRg/SMtC_p-yzfU/s1600/Bus-ticket-D5.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-y2wIKuf62hw/TssA6W4Ll9I/AAAAAAAARRg/SMtC_p-yzfU/s320/Bus-ticket-D5.jpg" width="276" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The bus was crowded and I was standing near the last row. I asked the conductor, "How much does the ticket cost to Marathahalli?". He said, "10 Rupees". I gave him 10 rupees and was waiting for the ticket. He distributed the tickets to passengers going to other destinations, but not to me. One more guy asked for Marathahalli and he did not get the ticket either. When the conductor was about to move away, I stopped him and asked for ticket. He said, "Give me three more rupees". I looked at him hard and gave him 10 rupees. He scolded me for not giving him exact change, issued the ticket and moved away. The other guy also stopped him and got his ticket.&amp;nbsp;The bus was too crowded, that I did not get into a discussion, but decided to lodge a complaint anyway.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I just made few assumptions and did a small math. Around 6200 buses run in BMTC alone. Consider that Silk Board to Marathahalli is not even half the trip distance for D5 bus, the conductor already cheated Rs. 20. Assume Rs.10 to average and atleast 10 trips in a day for a bus, the amount that BMTC loses to its conductors is 6200 X 10 X 10 = &lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: red;"&gt;Rs. 6,20,000/day&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; and for an financial year it turns out to be a whopping amount of &lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: red;"&gt;Rs.22,63,00,000 = Rs. 22&amp;nbsp;crore&amp;nbsp;approx.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes. I know what you are thinking. Not all the conductors are like that. OK. Also, the amount that I assumed Rs.10 is very less. Lets change the % of fraud conductors and see what happens.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;50% - 11 crore approx.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;25% - 5.5 crore approx.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: red;"&gt;&lt;b&gt;10% - 2.2 crore approx.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You might save few bucks&amp;nbsp;travelling&amp;nbsp;without tickets, but see how much BMTC is losing?. Who are they to steal our hard-earned money? We are not talking about the few bucks. We are talking about crores of rupees. With proper&amp;nbsp;re-investments, we can have better infrastructure and may be even reduction in the ticket price. Would you stand with me?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What to do, if you find any irregularity with the BMTC?.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure that you get your ticket first. (whatever the case, not issuing tickets, abusing etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Inform him/her that you are going to file an online complaint with BTIS.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If possible, try to capture his/her picture or at least get his/her name.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please note the Route No and the Bus Registration No.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Go to this link&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.btis.in/bus/ticket"&gt;http://www.btis.in/bus/ticket&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and file a complaint.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Make sure that you complaint every time, you come across a situation.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.btis.in/bus/ticket" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" target="_blank"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="197" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MCXgx_MML_8/TssPLy9oKCI/AAAAAAAARR0/3U0XBkbBP6Y/s320/BTIS+complaint+page.JPG" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What could BMTC do to stop the irregularities?.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;"&gt;BTIS could give us a compliant number rather than a simple "Thank You". It would be easy to track or to use RTI to get the updates.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frequent Ticket Checking on the routes where you receive more complaints would be needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is a hot-line, the passengers can call and lodge a complaint right from the bus. The Officials can talk to the conductors right on the spot. Because, there is NO proof that can be produced for any of these complaints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
There are some positive feedbacks that BTIS actually acts on all the complaints. Lets see what happens !&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: blue;"&gt;Question: Have you encountered any such issues with any public transport system?. What did you do?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Interesting title. I liked the book design also. Simple but different from the other books. Every chapter begins with a deep orange color page with a bold chapter number on the other side. The book is filled with lots of images, white space to make notes, readable font, good quality paper and it's very nice to hold and read. So, I decided to read the book without even reading a chapter from this book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After reading this book, your perception about design would change drastically as it happened to me. Before this book, I thought design is designer's job. Period. But that's not true. Here the author Robert introduces a concept called "&lt;i&gt;Customer experience supply chain&lt;/i&gt;". I will let the author explain in his words,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="tr_bq"&gt;
Close your eyes and imagine that you are holding an iPod. Now take away iTunes, take away the ability to buy the song for 99 cents without having to pay for the entire CD, lose the ability to create&amp;nbsp;playlist, cut out the packaging, delete the Apple logo and shutter all the aesthetically designed Apple stores. "Is it still an iPod?". No, it's not,&amp;nbsp;because&amp;nbsp;and iPod is an portal to the kaleidoscope of experience.&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The physical product or service is the central and most crucial part. But the successful design is about everything that comes in contact with the customers. How the customers feel when they enter your stores or buy your product online, how they feel when they open the package and take out the product, how they feel when they use it, if something goes wrong, what's the experience with the customer service. When you expand your idea of design to everything, then design becomes everyone's job. If you can make people emotionally attached to the experience of buying and using your product, then you have a successful&amp;nbsp;design. You can compare the examples of Motorola Razr and the iPod. Both are brilliantly designed products. But what happened to Razr?. Well. they didn't get the idea of design quite well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lets check what's in this book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Design Matters:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; You get a new idea of "&lt;i&gt;Customer experience supply chain&lt;/i&gt;", with lots of real world examples. This definitely changes the way you think about design.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Do You Matter:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Every CEO should read this chapter (I wish). The author asks a lot of thought provoking questions which would be a real eye opener for many companies. "&lt;i&gt;Why should people bother if you are out of business?. Why do you matter?&lt;/i&gt;". Very simple question, but how many companies has an answer to this question. You matter, only if the customers believe that their world will be a darker place with you. How many companies&amp;nbsp;achieved&amp;nbsp;this level of emotional attachment with the customers?.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;How To Matter:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Robert explains how to use design to create a relationship with the customer that matters and how the design of products and services creates and emotional connection with the customers. Lots of examples as usual.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Being Design Driven:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; He again takes the example of Apple and explains how a design driven company like Apple functions and what are all the difficulties that may surface between the design, engineering and&amp;nbsp;manufacturing&amp;nbsp;departments.He gives us a preview of what your company would look like, if you are to change your model to a design driven model.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Next three chapters "Your Brand Is Not Your Logo", "Products As Portals" and "Your Products And Services Are Talking To People" essentially explains in detail what was discussed in the previous chapters. I feel all these three chapters are redundant and could have been&amp;nbsp;accommodated&amp;nbsp;to other chapters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Building A Design Driven Culture:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; When your company is working on a certain model and if you change it suddenly to an entirely different model, what do you expect?. He explains how the culture of the company should be changed and nurtured by the leadership to excel in design driven model. Remember design is everyone's job. Many companies outsource a whole bunch of their manufacturing, packaging and logistics to different vendors in different countries to reduce the cost. Robert gives suggestions to handle that scenario and again how Apple manages that. He talks a little bit about leadership and also how to hire creative talents and retain them. Basically, if you own a company, this chapter is a must read. Other can ignore this chapter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If at all there is one thing that irritated me when I was reading this book, it would be the "Apple Example". The author has beaten the "Apple Example" to death in every chapter and for every concept that he discusses. Just because he is the Director of Industrial Design for Apple?. Well, in that case he could have changed the title to "Why Apple Matters?".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you are into Industrial Design or an&amp;nbsp;Entrepreneur or Just curious to know about design or just about Apple, you can read this. For others this book may not be an interesting read.&amp;nbsp;The author's mind is full of&amp;nbsp;usable&amp;nbsp;data, but failed to present it in a non-redundant, interesting manner.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Book:&lt;/b&gt; Resident Dormitus&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Author:&lt;/b&gt; Vikas Rathi&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;ISBN:&lt;/b&gt; 8129117541&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;ISBN-13:&lt;/b&gt; 9788129117540,978-8129117540&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Binding:&lt;/b&gt; Paperback&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Publishing Date:&lt;/b&gt; 2011&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Publisher:&lt;/b&gt; Rupa &amp;amp; Company-new Delhi&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Could a person be always nonchalant and care-free? That too a boy who was born and brought up in the culture rich India? Well, that’s what Achet is, our hero. I started reading the book with no expectations and an open mind. Rupa &amp;amp; Co’s publishing hiked the credibility even before I started reading. Vikas definitely has a dark sense of humor and a deep philosophical insight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The story starts with a guy entering into corporate world afresh and reckless. The very first day he boozes and misses the training. My eyes literally popped out at this! Now, you can imagine what sort of character he could be to do such stuff. To be honest, I can never even imagine doing something like that. While Achet is like this, there is Dev who is an icon of spoiled brat. Then come Arjuna, Alex and Bala. This could be anyone’s story except for few of the eye rolling factors. I was able to connect to every character in some or other way and that made me go deeper into the plot.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was very much happy about philosophies sprinkled here and there in the story. It added to the story’s aroma, bringing out even the trivial knots of life. No superficial words and exaggeration made the story almost real and practical. Evasive attitude of the new joiners was well portrayed. Singapore and Kaulalampur was picturized in such a way that I felt they are no way different from any Indian Metropolitan city.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
At some point, I thought, “Am I reading the upgraded version of five-point someone (what not to do at corporate instead of IIT)?” No, this book is definitely not an upgraded version of five-point someone. You might find some traces here and there but this is so different.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The jokes and pranks of Achet are so pervert. It’s gone overboard when he speaks to those sales people. Is that really necessary? His height of recklessness is shown at various places and makes you raise an eyebrow. Arjuna’s extremism raises many questions in mind. Dev is pathetic but I hardly felt any sympathy for him. Bala was just another girl with no great role in the story.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The climax is the X factor of the novel and will surely hit your nerves. My heart skipped a beat reading the last few pages. I was so furious and confused at the same time. How many of us can coolly handle the suicide of a friend? That too if it happens in front of our eyes? I leave it to the readers to decide upon that. Many would find the climax as a big cliché. But that is where the story’s beauty lies. It makes the whole novel unique and not a monotonous repetition.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I found the book very contradicting. It’s so real and surreal at the same time. There are many close-tothe-heart scenes and some dumb scenes too. I really liked the originality of the script and the boldness of the author to write what he actually wanted. Very promising writing and really a commendable work. Might take some time for the story’s depth to descend upon but once it does a strong wave is sure to hit your heart. Many wouldn’t like it at the first read and find it either too philosophical or too fictional. But,I strongly suggest reading this book and later ponder upon the thoughts presented in the book. I can bet that something new would dawn upon you. Great work Vikas! Expecting more books in future!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Many books on&amp;nbsp;Personal Finance Management gives a lot of tips, tricks &amp;amp;&amp;nbsp;advice&amp;nbsp;to manage our finances well. The main reasons why many people don't follow it through the years are, either the concepts explained are very abstract or it requires a lot of discipline to follow the advice year after year. There are other kinds of books which show you a literally non-existent route to become rich overnight. David Bach differs very much from the others. He shows us&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The practical proven techniques which will make you rich over the years.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;How to make all of them automatic, so that you don't have to test your will power.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You don't need to make a lot of money to become rich. You just need to invest whatever you earn wisely.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The best part is that you can read this book in an hour or two and setting up the automated plans may take another couple of hours. That's all David asks from you to make you rich. Interesting?. For me too.&amp;nbsp;The book's title is "Automatic Millionaire". This doesn't mean that, if you follow all the tactics explained in this book, you will become a millionaire. It depends on how early you start saving, how much you are saving and how long you are planning to work. But, the sure thing is that you will be richer when you retire, if you follow the simple concepts explained in this book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I will provide a gist of some of the concepts explained in this book. But I would prefer you to read the book by yourself.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;The Latte Factor:&amp;nbsp;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; This is for those who live from paycheck to paycheck and have nothing to save. David asks us to track each and every penny spent for a day/week. There will definitely be some dimes, dollars that you can save in little things. Most of us ignore this, because the amount is too small to save. But David shows us, those little amount can grow into huge investments, if invested properly. I think, this is interesting and I started tracking my expenses for a month. Let me see how much I can save.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Pay Yourself First:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; If you earn a dollar, your govt takes close to 30 cents and you are left with only 70 cents for everything including your savings. He suggests that pre-tax savings are the bound to grow faster than post-tax savings, considering you plan to save the same amount in both the cases. He explains it with the detailed tables and shows us how much we would "lose", if we don't save pre-tax amount. 401(k), 403(B), 457 plans in US are best suited for these kind of savings. In India, we can save 12% in PF, and 88% in VPF and more in PPF. Suggestion from David -&amp;nbsp;If possible, max out the investments that is allowed. I decided to put 88% in VPF.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Three Rules of Emergency Money:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; No one can escape from a bad day, unless we are prepared for it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Decide how big a cushion you need - David suggests that we need to have three to twenty four month's expenses as reserve money for any unforeseen consequences.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Don't touch it&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Put it in the right place - Make sure that your emergency cash earns you interest, when you are not using it. Money markets, Short term govt bonds etc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Debt-Free Home Ownership:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; "You can get rich renting. Landlords get rich and renters stay poor". Home is the only thing that David suggests you to buy on debt. Some of the reasons are&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Forced Savings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Leverage&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Other People's Money&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tax Breaks&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Pride of Ownership&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Great Investment&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
David gives us elaborate tips to close the loans earlier than the actual tenure. I am gonna use them on my home loan.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Credit Card Debts:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Just like Warren Buffet, David suggests us NOT to use credit cards. "&lt;i&gt;Millionaires don't do debt!&lt;/i&gt;." Either you have credit card debt or not, you should probably read this chapter as well. He gives us techniques to pay off the debt in a reasonable amount of time, to negotiate with the banks on the interest rates, which credit cards to pay and what are the things to consider when balance&amp;nbsp;transferring&amp;nbsp;the debt. etc., I am going to use these tips with &lt;a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2011/10/hdfc-bank-we-understand-your-world.html" target="_blank"&gt;HDFC Bank&lt;/a&gt; on the recent fraud charges on my credit card.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Tithing:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Giving back to the Society!. Here he gets philosophical. "The more you give, the more you receive." No scientific evidence, but personal and statistical evidence for tithing. 10% of your income is ideal. More or less depends on your heart. As always, you get tax&amp;nbsp;exemptions&amp;nbsp;on the donations to charity. I won't stress on this factor. I have been tithing for a long time and I don't see any direct correlation to the money that I earn. Or at least, not yet !.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The beauty is that this book is packed with all the resources that you may need to make all the above automatic, so that you don't miss anything !.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Thanks David !. For a wonderful book packed with real, practical wisdom.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Jeffrey Stibel is a brain scientist and entrepreneur, who is the chairman of &lt;a href="http://www.braingate.com/" target="_blank"&gt;BrainGate&lt;/a&gt;, a brain-implant company that allows people to use their thoughts to control electrical devices and also the president of &lt;a href="http://www.web.com/" target="_blank"&gt;web.com&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;which helps&amp;nbsp;entrepreneurs&amp;nbsp;to grow their business in the web. Most importantly, this book is recommended by my all time&amp;nbsp;favorite&amp;nbsp;author &lt;a href="http://www.johnassaraf.com/" target="_blank"&gt;John Assaraf&lt;/a&gt;. What else you need to read this book?.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Stibel says that "The Internet is a brain". This is because the Internet (unlike computers) has&amp;nbsp;evolved&amp;nbsp;with many of the basic structures and abilities of the brain. He compares the evolution of human brains over the millions of years with the evolution of the network of computers (i.e. Internet) and concludes that both follow the same pattern. He claims that the network of neurons in our brain is similar to the network of computers in Internet. He doesn't claim that the Internet may become "conscious" in human sense in future. But, it will be capable of creating a collective consciousness.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is divided into four sections with multiple chapters.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Part I - Building the Brain:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; From a scientist perspective, he explains the human brain's thinking capability and its limitations. Three most important things to the brain: information storage, processing and communication with other neurons. As of now, the Internet does information storage and communication. Cloud computing does the processing. &amp;nbsp;What would happen, if we upgrade the Internet with Cloud computing?. We can&amp;nbsp;achieve&amp;nbsp;what &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce" target="_blank"&gt;MapReduce&lt;/a&gt; did for google.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Part II - Internet Intelligence:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; The human brain does not calculate all the possible combinations of output for making a decision. It makes decision with little information (Instinct?). Its very good at predicting where the cricket ball will land after a sixer without knowing its velocity, trajectory path etc, rather than predicting the weather next day. To process very little information, you don't need supercomputers. You get the idea?. Also, he talks about "Creative Destruction" in a separate chapter. How neurons lose the connections after maturing into a complete brain is analogous to the way many websites/companies disappear from the web.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Part III - The Brain behind the Web:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; He compares the websites to &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme" target="_blank"&gt;memes&lt;/a&gt;. In a chapter, he discusses how the search engines work (primarily google) and the competition between the websites to appear on the first page of the search results is analogous to the Survival of the fittest - Darwinism. He is one of the man behind the algorithm that propels Google's Adsense. He discusses the importance of understanding the language to select the right ads based on the keywords. Very Interesting!.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Metcalfe's law is discussed in detail and why it did not work. He defines the stages of the Networking as&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ol style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Big Bang&lt;/b&gt; - The Internet, ant colonies and the brain, all have periods of rapid expansion. Stunting its growth is dangerous at this time.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Collapse&lt;/b&gt; - When the network become too big, either it will implode (the brain loses half of its neurons) or its growth will slow rapidly (as with ant colonies). You should allow the network to stabilize.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Equilibrium&lt;/b&gt; - Its the stage, where the network oscillates roughly around a certain size. The network is at its peak performance. (like a matured brain)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
Further, he discusses in detail about the Social Networks and the advantages "facebook" has over the other similar sites. Very interesting to see where the web is going !.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Part IV - I, Internet:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; This is the very interesting section of the entire book, which discusses where the Internet is heading to?. Some of the predictions are...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Internet algorithms will mature and start discarding/penalizing links that are irrelevant, unnatural or fake. (W3C or ICANN?)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Websites will pull information from various sites to create collages of new information, dynamically (a semantic web).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The hyperlinks will evolve to incorporate dynamic weighting based on how many people click or how relevant the link is. (think as a color code, red - best, blue - Good, yellow - OK etc)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The Internet will be able to modify and create Web Sites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The search engines will evolve into dynamic portals - search for anything and you will be presented with a dynamically created page from contents all over the world. You don't need to go to the specific websites.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Virtual Reality will become an extension of real life or in some cases a replacement. Check out &lt;a href="http://www.habbo.com/" target="_blank"&gt;Habbo&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;or &lt;a href="http://secondlife.com/" target="_blank"&gt;SecondLife&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;websites. Already millions of people are in virtual worlds spending real money (millions of $$$).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
When I first started reading this book, I thought Stibel is going to present the SEO concepts in Brain flavour. But, I was wrong. I have a completely new perspective of the Internet. With this information and perspective, we can fine-tune our websites for long time survival in the Web. Many of these things are already happening. Let's jump in and have fun. Thanks to Stibel for a wonderful book.&lt;br /&gt;

Donald J.Trump. Who doesn't know him in the business circle? He is an excellent example of American business success story, who had his hands on real estate, gaming, sports and Entertainment. He is one of the New York Times bestselling author as well. What if Donald Trump goes to the best &amp;amp; brightest business men and women, who run companies ranging from Fortune 500 Corporations to the family-run local businesses and ask them ONLY ONE question.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"What is the best business advice you ever received?"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
And compiled them into one book? Wouldn't that be a wikipedia of most common of the problems, solutions, strategies, ethics, work culture, leadership, people management etc in business?. Exactly. And, this book has the collective wisdom gained by those who are already in the top. This book will definitely help you NOT to make the same mistakes made by those who traveled ahead of you. If you are an entrepreneur seriously interested to find your way to the top, this book should be in your book-shelf.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After reading the answers from Presidents, CEOs, CFOs, COOs, MDs, I could sense that their best advice comes from various sources. Majority are from their seniors (in major corporations), from their fathers (in family-run businesses), from their juniors, from their mom in their childhood, from an occasional talk in a party etc. It comes from people from all walks of life. Many leaders hold on to these advices which brought them success. So, along with reading this book, you should listen to people and watch for any lessons that you may get.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some of leaders answered in one sentence, some in a paragraph, some listed the advices that guides them and some explains the actual experience from their business life where &amp;amp; how the advice actually helped them. Some of my favorites are here.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Put yourself in the customer’s shoes. Sell the medicine as if they would be used by my family, my friends or myself” - George Abercrombie, President and CEO of Roche North American Pharmaceuticals Operations&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
“What would be the best thing that could happen from this decision and what would be the worst thing that could happen?. Put your decisions to rigorous analysis” – William C.Byham, Chairman &amp;amp; CEO of Development Dimensions International, Inc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“Strive to satisfy the customer. The bottom line will always follow” – Jim Cantalupo, Chairman &amp;amp; CEO of McDonald’s corporation.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
“If you can’t write your strategy or idea on the back of your business card, it’s too complex to execute. Keep it simple” – Dawn Hudson, North America President of Pepsi-Cola, Inc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“When you must make a difficult decision, you are not going to be liked or approved of by everyone” – Timothy H.Ling, President &amp;amp; COO of Union Oil of California.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“The purpose of business is to create value year after year, forever” – Alan Mulally, President &amp;amp; CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes Group.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“In any given situation, don’t rely on a single solution. Develop a parallel path that could be used in the event that the original solution does not come to bear” – Don Nigbor, Chairman &amp;amp; CEO of Benchmark Electronics, Inc.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
“If they don’t have the authority to say yes, then they don’t have the authority to say no. Deal directly with the decision makers” – Roxanne Quimby, President of Burt’s Bees.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
I wish I could hold time&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
And be here forever&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
As long as the stars live&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
But all I have is tonight&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
Take me in your arms&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
Hold me for very last time&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
Like you could never let go&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
For all I have is tonight&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
Let's try and fool the time&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
And live this night forever&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
Like there is no tomorrow&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
Beyond the confines of tonight&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
Don't look at the clock&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
For the time's ticking away&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
To tear me away from you&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
For all we have is tonight&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
Take my life in return&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
But give me your love&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
To stay buried in my heart&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
Even after long tonight&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
And I shall never be alone&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
Till death do us apart&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
If only you give me your love&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
And never take back this night&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
When the morning creeps up&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
And wrenches you from me&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
I'll go back to sleep&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
And pretend its still tonight&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
Down the lanes of future&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
I'll smile though my tears&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
When I look back at you&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
And embrace the memories of tonight&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;

&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-08zFoyyWPFU/TqRYe2chS8I/AAAAAAAARBk/N3W8DBmLsjA/s1600/HDFC-logo.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="98" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-08zFoyyWPFU/TqRYe2chS8I/AAAAAAAARBk/N3W8DBmLsjA/s320/HDFC-logo.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Why this post?. What is it that I want to communicate to the world about HDFC Bank?. Just my recent bitter experiences with HDFC. I have been banking with HDFC for the past 7 years. I am one of the high value card member who always pays in full and never defaulted a single payment in my life. Here is what happened...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I came back from California on 21-Jun-2011, stayed in B'lore for two days and I went for a vacation for my brother's marriage. Very unfortunately, I lost my HDFC Platinum credit card 5243-XXXX-XXXX-8957 on 23-Jun-2011 and took a new mobile number in Chennai. I did not use the card for the past 6 months and I almost forgot the email statements. My new mobile number is not updated in HDFC Bank records. :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Someone used my card like his own and purchased items from Jewellery, Dish TVs, Mobile phones, MP3 players, Shoes, Sarees, School bags for kids and even groceries for about Rs. 1 lakh. Even I did not use my card like this. OK. So far, so good.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I got the statement on 25-Jul-2011 and I was very much surprised to see the transactions and realized that I lost my card. I called up HDFC Bank and blocked the card immediately. HDFC Bank advised me to file an FIR with the police station. I went to HAL police station and surprised to know that the police NEVER file an FIR for credit card loss. The police push these cases under &lt;a href="http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/indianpenalcode/S403.htm"&gt;Section 403&lt;/a&gt;. Banks know this. Hmmm... I got an acknowledgement from the Police and formally registered a compliant with Risk Control Unit of HDFC Bank. Ref # ULRL1208110009224. RCU informed me that they will start the investigation and I do not need to pay anything till the investigation is over. I was very happy :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Meanwhile, I got the next month's statement with all the transactions + interest + late payment charges, followed by a phone call from HDFC Customer &lt;i&gt;Care &lt;/i&gt;(?). The guy on the phone was very harsh, shouted at me for not paying the dues. I got pissed off and shouted back at him left and right. I called up RCU to check and they said that their investigation systems and the statement generation systems are not in sync and they do not work together. They asked me to ignore the&amp;nbsp;statements&amp;nbsp;and the phone calls till the investigation is over.&amp;nbsp;I was like $!@#$%^&amp;amp;*. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Why don't you guys work together?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
After few weeks, Mr. Prakash collected the details of all the merchants and the video footage of the thief from the CC TV of the last merchant, where the card is declined. Here is the video.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://i.ytimg.com/vi/MNEH4yyInm4/0.jpg" height="266" width="320"&gt;&lt;param name="movie" value="http://www.youtube.com/v/MNEH4yyInm4?version=3&amp;f=user_uploads&amp;c=google-webdrive-0&amp;app=youtube_gdata" /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
(&lt;i&gt;The guy in white shirt behind the red shirt is the thief. He stays somewhere near Kadugodi in bangalore. Anyone happens to see him, please call Prem @98869-71858. Thank You!&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So far so good. Mr. Prakash promised me to accompany to the Police station and file an FIR with the evidences that its not a loss, but a fraud too. Three weeks passed and no response from him after repeated calls and SMS. Meanwhile, I was sending emails to HDFC bank for the same. Mr. Madhu was assigned for this case and he took me to Airport Road Police Station. He said they are his friends and will investigate without FIR. I insisted on an FIR. He said, "&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The card was lost near ITPL and you stay in Marathahalli. Both the areas does not come under this police station. So, they cannot file an FIR. The HAL Police won't be of much help. That's why I brought you here. If you don't like, pay the entire amount to HDFC Bank. Your choice !&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;". I was little surprised when Mr. Madhu asked me to pay Rs.3000 to the police to start the investigation. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;Would you like to pay Rs. 1 lakh to the bank or Rs. 3000 to the police?. Since they do this for you off the record, you need to pay for their travel expenses.&lt;/b&gt; - &lt;/i&gt;Argument from Mr. Madhu (an HDFC Bank Representative). I paid to Mr.Venkata Swamy @ Airport Road Police Station. Yes. I did. I just wanted this to get over. But the Police is still searching the thief (as of 23-Oct-2011).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
While all these are happening, my credit card statement was filled with interests and late payment charges (remember, I was advised by RCU that I need not make any payments). I was not sure how long this case is going to continue. So, I sent an email to the bank stating that "&lt;i&gt;Please cancel all the interests / whatever charges that the Bank imposed on my account and convert all the transactions into EMI (without interest). I will pay the EMI of the credit card theft amount.&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
HDFC Bank promptly replied, "&lt;i&gt;We regret to inform you that we are unable to process your request of conversion of the said transaction into Equated Monthly installments. We sincerely regret the inconvenience caused to you as we are unable to accede to your request at this point of time. We request our cardholders to effect required payment towards the card dues to avoid levy of applicable bank charges.&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Both the HDFC Bank and I know that, it was a fraud on my card. &lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;I don't want HDFC Bank to lose money because of my carelessness.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt; I offered to pay the entire amount, knowing that the thief may not be caught at all. All I asked is just to remove the interests and other charges. Is that too big a request for HDFC bank?.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Lessons Learnt from this Credit Card Fraud:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Always keep your mobile number updated with your Banks. They send SMS for each and every transactions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you have the habit of switching mobile numbers when going to home town/vacation, please double check that your credit/debit cards are safe and with you.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;"Zero Liability" is a scam used by ALL the banks. It covers the transactions happened after you report the loss of card to the Bank. In reality, it takes few seconds to block the card after you report. How many transactions can happen in those few seconds?. So, don't trust this and exercise extra caution.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Avoid Credit Cards if possible. The banks make a lot of money and you get peanuts in the name of reward points. Warren Buffet advises NOT to use Credit Cards and says "&lt;a href="http://www.warrenbuffett.com/warren-buffett-10-ways-to-get-rich/"&gt;Limit What You Borrow&lt;/a&gt;".&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I am not using Credit Cards for close to an year now and I am as good as before. I can better manage my expenses now. Trust me. There is NO big difference.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I suggest to get a credit card and use it ONLY for emergencies and make sure that you pay it off in FULL. Never ever get into revolving mode. You get stuck !.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never pay anything to the Police. It does not make any big difference. Go to the court, if you have time !.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;What HDFC Bank Could have done better?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;ul style="text-align: left;"&gt;
&lt;li&gt;For a high value transaction for Rs.38,500 @ Chemmanur Jewellery, HDFC Bank tried to send an SMS and followed by a phone call. The main reason for phone call verification is to avoid credit card fraud. When you are not able to reach the customer, please pro-actively make efforts to reach the customer. You could have sent an email and / or temporarily block the card. I would be more than happy rather than pissed off.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Integrate all your internal systems (statement systems, RCU etc) and make sure that you know everything before calling the customer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please advise your customer care representatives to be polite while talking to the customers. Review the customer's payment history and get to know the customer before making assumptions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When the customer is loyal and trying to settle all the dues with sincere efforts, please assist by providing him options.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The customers know that banks come to the settlement for a less amount when customers are not ready to pay the dues. I do not want to force HDFC bank to such a situation, since my morality does not allow that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Please remember "The Customer is the King" and treat him as such. Once the dues are settled, I will move on to another bank. You have just lost a customer. Please don't lose many more. All the best !&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Question: Whom do you bank with?. Do you have any such bitter / better experiences?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Alexander the Great was known and called as “Sikandar” in India after his invasion. So, wait! Is the book “Sikandar” penned by Binayak Banerjee in Bengali and translated to English by Soma Ghosh about Alexander or some Indian king? Curiosity led me to book back. As soon as I read the gist of the story from the last page, I could not help thinking about Stone Cold Steve Austin’s movie “The Condemned”. The story of the movie is that 10 condemned criminals will be left to fight in an island and only one will survive. The plot of this novel is similar, where the author has attempted to portray 10 tangled personalities, the turmoil and vehemence between them, who are locked under the same roof contesting in a reality show. This could be Binayak’s original idea, but a movie was already made out of this idea. I thought "Let’s read anyway".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The story begins with a news broadcast where the newsreader does a live report with the participants. What is so quizzing is that how come a news broadcast focuses so much only this program details that too even before it begins. For crying out loud, there is no trace about the program’s public response and popularity considering the hype given in the beginning. Each character introduces them giving a brief background. The one who leaves the house last will be declared as true ‘Sikandar’. The contestants are diversified. They range from a prominent politician to a poor guy, leaving the reader snooping who the winner will be. Author has beautifully portrayed the other side of celebrities giving us a look into their fears, passion, greed and humanity. However, there are high chances that the reader might get lost in the over populated characters and it’s pretty hard to track and remember character as the story progress.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To add to the tousled story, comes an unsolved murder and a scandal. Pace at which the plot moves is very sluggish and fails to have a grip on the reader, though a deep insight about every character can be obtained in the run. It would have been highly intriguing had the author shed some light on how the program was broadcasted or the whereabouts of contestants’ selection. But guess what?. You do not know that till the end. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to connect with any character though there was a handful. Probably that’s why it didn’t come close to my heart and gave me a feel “It is just yet another book.” The novel leaves you wondering, “What the author is trying to tell in the end?” Despite all these drawbacks, the climax was totally unpredictable and also gives you the flavor of the reality shows’ shadow side though how hard you think you will never be able to figure the logic behind it. Although I haven’t read the Bengali version, I somehow felt that translation hasn’t crippled the essence and originality. Good work Soma!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To sum up in a single line ‘Sikandar is a kaleidoscope’. It shows different colors and patterns but no value or moral to back up. Can be chosen to read casually or for a train journey.&lt;br /&gt;

If a picture is worth thousand words, how about a video then?. Here is an introductory video to EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique). It is very essential that you know about EFT, before reading the review about this book. I found this is the best video that was ever made for EFT. Watch it completely before you scroll down for the book review.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
The Traditional Chinese Medicine claims that there is a path through which the life-energy known as "qi" flows. They are called Meridians or Energy Meridians. Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) proposed by&amp;nbsp;Gary Craig in 1993 states that "The cause of all negative emotions is a disruption in the body's energy system". Those energy blockages can be released by simply tapping on the energy meridians, while recalling the memory which brings about the negative emotions. EFT claims that it cured a wide variety of emotional issues and physical pain/diseases etc. The beauty of EFT is that, once you have identified the correct memory and the aspect and tapped it properly, it fixes the problem immediately and the results are usually permanent. The Basic Recipe process takes hardly two minutes to perform and anyone can easily learn to perform it without difficulty.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
On the other side, Critics say that there is no known anatomical basis for the existence of acupuncture points or meridians and even if EFT works, there is no tangible proof that "tapping of energy meridians" actually brought the results.Several controlled studies shows that EFT actually works, but concluded that any benefit is due to traditional cognitive components, such as the placebo effect, the distraction from negative thoughts, and the therapeutic benefit of having someone actually listen, rather than from manipulation of meridians.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Yes. Science won't accept it, till it has verifiable proof. But, Should we wait till then?. Let the scientists work hard to find the reason and lets start using EFT meanwhile. It takes hardly two minutes and no side effects. If it works, be happy. Otherwise, forget it. What's a big deal?. I have used it on myself for few haunting emotions and I am better now. Great!. EFT claims that it can cure physical ailments as well. I am perfectly healthy and in perfect shape. I can try this on my eyesight. Yes, I have myopia of 3.5 diopters as of Sep 10, 2011. I will post an update to this blog, if I improve my eyesight using EFT :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Lets start the review of the book now. The founder of EFT&amp;nbsp;Gary Craig wrote this book, explaining everything in detail. The book is divided into two parts. The first part explains the origin of EFT and details the lists of scientific studies, controlled trials and comparitive studies done on EFT. I suggest you to read this chapter completely, so that your mind will be prepared and receptive to the future chapters. This is quite elaborate. I would love to shrink this chapter in future editions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The next chapter is the "How-to" of EFT. Its takes you through the step-by-step process to learn EFT. By the end of this chapter, you would be proficient in applying the Basic&amp;nbsp;Recipe&amp;nbsp;to some of your emotional/physical problems. Yeah. Its that easy !. This portion covers the Psychological Reversal, Aspects,&amp;nbsp;Generalization&amp;nbsp;Effect, Peace Procedure, Movie &amp;amp; Story Technique etc. These chapters are precise and to the point. I love this chapter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The second part explains the advanced concepts in EFT, which you may not need in most of the cases. But, be sure that you know these.&amp;nbsp;Collarbone Breathing Exercise,&amp;nbsp;Shortcuts, Energy Toxins, 9 Gamut Procedure etc. There is an elaborate chapter on Frequently Asked Questions, which answers most of your questions about EFT. Lots of real world case studies are also included for your reference. (Just the names &amp;amp; incidents... No references). More advanced concepts like Surrogate Tapping, Borrowing Benefits etc can be learnt in the workshops.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Gary Craig gave out all the information that he "invented" for free to the world. But, there are lot of people who just modify the content, rename it and make a lot of money out it. Still, you get a lot of free information over the internet, free newletters to your emails etc. Here are some of the links.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
"Not a poet, but an off tune mind that dares to speak in free verse." - That's how Shreya writes in the preface. I completely agree with her. I had huge expectation before reading this book. But, I was disappointed. Since, this is her first book on poetry, I am OK. I guess, She should have waited for some more time to improve her skills, get feedback from different sources (not just friends), refine her skills and then should have come to the publishing world. Print media is completely different from the blog media. Once printed, it stays in history. Instead of publishing all she has written, she should have selected the best few and make a best first impression.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Poems - to me is a mean to convey the feelings from one mind to another. The scene, the situation, the movie, the characters should expand in our mind, when we read the poems. We should feel that we are part of what's happening or at least we are witnessing it. That feeling is missing in most of the poems. Some of the poems read like news. However, I like some of the poems. Here are few of my likes ...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The last company in the park&lt;br /&gt;
2. A girl scribbling&lt;br /&gt;
3. I will be around&lt;br /&gt;
4. Blood&lt;br /&gt;
5. A brother to me. (I liked this very much. I can co-relate myself to this poem)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I could have simply written a review "nice book", "good to read" etc. Would that help Shreya?. I don't think so. Whatever I told is what I felt after reading the book. The reason I am very much disappointed is that my friends Sunita and Binti also write poems. They are awesome. But they are least bothered either to blog it or publish it. So, when I have a printed book in my hand, I think you can guess my expectations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Shreya - Sometime down the line, I expect another poetry book from you. My review of that book should have only one word "awesome". All the best !&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I knew Malcom Gladwell through his earlier book "&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316010669/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=booiverea-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=217145&amp;amp;creative=399369&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0316010669"&gt;Blink&lt;/a&gt;". This guy always thinks out of the box and gives a new perspective to the well known things. He always amazes me. In his new book "&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316017930/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=booiverea-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=217145&amp;amp;creative=399369&amp;amp;creativeASIN=0316017930"&gt;Outliers&lt;/a&gt;", he gives us a different perspective on Why successful people are successful?. &amp;nbsp;The general notion is that the successful people became so, because of who they are. But, Gladwell tells us that its more because of where they are from?. Sounds confusing?. For me too, when I started. Not anymore :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He starts off with the analysis of the hockey players in Canadian teams. One interesting fact is that most of the best players in the team are born in the first three months (Jan, Feb, Mar). He concludes that its because of the selection procedure followed in Canada and the additional playing time these kids get in their early years. This is definitely a different insight and he suggest the alternate means as well.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He analyses the life history of most successful software people like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Bill Joy, the most successful&amp;nbsp;entrepreneurs like Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, the most successful lawyers like Joe Flom, the most successful music troops like Beatles, the most successful immigrants like Louis and Regina Borgenicht etc and figures out the components that made them the Outliers.&amp;nbsp;Some of them are...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Time of their birth (right time)&lt;br /&gt;
The&amp;nbsp;Opportunities&amp;nbsp;they got (right place)&lt;br /&gt;
The Hard work they put in (10,000 hrs rule - right attitude)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
He concludes that these Outliers were present in the right time in the right place with the right attitude and become successful. He takes the examples of few other intellectual people who, unfortunately happen to be in the wrong time and not be able to become a success icon. Interesting, but I could not buy into this idea 100%.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I thought about the book "&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1582701709/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=booiverea-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=217145&amp;amp;creative=399369&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1582701709"&gt;The Secret&lt;/a&gt;" by Rhonda Brynes when I read Gladwell's conclusion. Gladwell says that Outliers are successful, because of the&amp;nbsp;opportunities they got. But, Rhonda Bryne says that you will create&amp;nbsp;opportunities&amp;nbsp;when you are determined in what you want to&amp;nbsp;achieve, according to the "Law Of Attraction". Gladwell explains why things are the way they are. Rhonda Bryne tells us how to create things.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Do you see the some correlation?. I do. I would suggest you to read the book "&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1582701709/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;tag=booiverea-20&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;camp=217145&amp;amp;creative=399369&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1582701709"&gt;The Secret&lt;/a&gt;" after reading this book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In further chapters, he discusses about the "Culture of Honor", why plane crashes happens and its relation to the culture they belong to, rice paddy fields and its relations to maths skills etc. Very interesting !...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Overall, a very good book. But I cannot agree with everything that he says. Its worth reading :)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
This is all I can say to Dr. Gary Chapman for writing such a beautiful, much needed book. I would recommend this book to ALL, irrespective of whether you are in love, married, living together or whatever is your marital status. This book packs a lot of real wisdom which can potentially save a lot of marriages from the brink of divorce. Imagine, what this book can do to the already amazing marriages and couples?. Dr. Gary Chapman guides us to identify the means to communicate your heart felt love to your spouse.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you speak in Japanese to a Chinese, he would not understand. So, does speaking in Tamil to native Indians. Its as simple as that. People feel loved when we express love in a way that they can understand. Dr. Chapman categorizes these variations in expressing love to five categories. He starts with the emotional "In-Love" experience and why that experience fades away slowly after marriage and points out what's missing. Its not that we do not love each other anymore, its just that we consistently fail to communicate love in a way that he/she understands it. Great.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Your love language and your spouses may not be the same and it could be difficult for you to learn and speak your spouse's language. But, do learn. The results are amazing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The five love languages are:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;1. Words of Affirmation:&lt;/b&gt; &amp;nbsp;Simple words of affirmation/appreciation from your heart. Appreciating the simple things that your spouse does for you. For some people, words mean much more than anything else in the world. These simple appreciations goes a long way in building that special relationship that everyone longs for.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;2. Quality Time:&lt;/b&gt; By quality time, he means giving your undivided attention to your spouse frequently. May be sitting with her in the couch and talking to her for 15 minutes a day (remember to switch off the TV). Listen. Let her talk. Don't give solutions, if she did not ask for it. Learning to listen could be difficult for many men. On an average we could listen for 7 seconds, before we pump our thoughts into the discussion. Just listen. Or just spend time with her. Go for a walk. Do things together.&amp;nbsp;As simple as that. For many women, this means a lot. Quality time during the extreme happiness and during crisis will remain in her memory till her last breath.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;3. Receiving Gifts:&lt;/b&gt; The gifts need not be expensive and we know that everyone cannot afford. But, gifts are the token of love which remains for a long time. You could pick up the flower in the back yard. Make a gift card by yourself or enroll yourself in an art class, just for creating a gift for her. Gift her and touch her heart and you get everything from her :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;4. Acts of Service:&lt;/b&gt; Some people express their love to their spouse by service. Jesus is a perfect example of this type. For some, giving gifts or spending time with her or praising her wont mean much, when the house is a mess, clothes all over the rooms and the yards need maintenance. So, if your spouses love language is Acts of Service, the only way to her heart is by doing things for her. May be, cleaning the dishes, doing the laundry and taking care of the baby when she is not well etc,.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;5. Physical Touch:&lt;/b&gt; Most men misunderstand that this is their primary language. By Physical Touch, Dr. Chapman doesn't refer only Sexual Intercourse. Of course&amp;nbsp;that's&amp;nbsp;most important for almost every men. But, need not necessarily be your primary love language. This language means holding the hands together, hugging, kissing, rubbing the back, sitting close in the couch and feeling great when your partner touches you (even in the day when you don't have sex).&lt;br /&gt;

January 24, 2008 - The World Economic Forum, Davos,&amp;nbsp;Switzerland. A speech by Bill Gates, one of the most successful&amp;nbsp;entrepreneur &amp;amp;amp; philanthropist created a whirl wind in the business circles. Gates proposed a new idea of making capitalism work for the poor and needy in the developing world. He coined the term "Creative Capitalism". This book is a compilation of discussions, blogs, critics by 43 well known successful business leaders, economists etc around the topic. Micheal Kinsley did a pretty good job in compiling 300+ pages with thought provoking ideas, approaches to Creative Capitalism. Many of you may have seen Gates speech on youtube or read the transcription in Microsoft website. But, after reading this entire book, you will have a complete knowledge, different thinking and a birds eye view of this topic. About the pros and cons of what was proposed by Bill Gates. Many of the business leaders do not agree with his idea of Creative Capitalism (with valid statistics and business ethics). Some, do agree with Bill Gates.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2008/01-24wefdavos.mspx" target="blank"&gt;Bill Gates: World Economic Forum 2008&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Here is the cheat sheet of Creative Capitalism:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
1. Markets respond only to "demand", not to "need".&lt;br /&gt;
2. The world is getting better, but not fast enough and not for everyone. For ex., Climate change will impose the worst effect on those least responsible for it.&lt;br /&gt;
3. In a system of pure capitalism, the incentive to serve people rises as their wealth rises and falls as their wealth falls. This needs to be changed so that there is an incentive to serve poor people too.&lt;br /&gt;
4. A revised capitalist system would&amp;nbsp;both&amp;nbsp;make a profit and improve the lives of the have-nots.&lt;br /&gt;
5. Creative Capitalism is a system where incentives for both profit and recognition motivate both self-interest and caring for others.&lt;br /&gt;
6. Under Creative Capitalism governments, businesses and non-profits works together.&lt;br /&gt;
7. Some real world scenarios are : Corporations donating money or products. Tiered pricing by drug companies for vaccines against diseases affecting third world. Help poor world business do business in developed world. The Bono RED campaign model.&lt;br /&gt;
8. Corporations should allow "top innovators" to spend part of their times on issues facing people too poor to be customers. This "takes the brainpower that makes life better for the richest, and dedicates it to improving the lives of everyone else".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book starts with the conversation with Warren Buffet, Bill Gates and author Micheal Kinsley. They discuss in detail about all the possibilities of making this concept to the real world. To my perception, Warren Buffet is much more experienced and knows what he puts forth on the table. Bill Gates is very impatient and wants to change the world very fast. Just like switching on a PC and start working. Warren Buffet suggests to tax 3% from the corporation and let a neutral body consisting of Government officials, Business leaders and NGO manage the fund to make the world a better place for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But Gates proposes a different approach, where the businesses using its technology &amp;amp;amp; resources get into the field of&amp;nbsp;philanthropy&amp;nbsp;directly. He urges the businesses to explore the unexploited business&amp;nbsp;opportunities&amp;nbsp;available in the sub-saharan&amp;nbsp;African&amp;nbsp;countries and thereby improving the lives of the less&amp;nbsp;privileged&amp;nbsp;people. He urges the corporations to donate huge amounts of money, resources or employees time for those who cannot afford it. What would the businesses get in return?. Recognition as do-gooders which will improve the company's reputation and in turn improves the profits. The ultimate aim is again profit&amp;nbsp;maximization. But, he does not mention who has to make the decision to decide the charitable cause. The corporate managers or the share holders or the stake holders?. There are a lot of practical complications around this. This could be an easy option for the companies that are about to go to IPO.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hundreds of pages discussing about each and every specific good and bad things in Gates speech. How is it different from Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)?. Why do we need a different form of capitalism?. etc. I&amp;nbsp;feel good about Bill Gates intention to eradicate poverty in the world through Creative Capitalism. But just the intention is not enough. A complete real world implementation plan is needed to make that a reality. Apart from the speech made at Davos, what else has been done in the past three years?. Where are we in this idea?. What Gates has done other than making a speech?.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We need more people like Gates to come together and persist in the idea, so that it becomes a goal of every corporation in this world. I would suggest everyone interested in business or has that entrepreneurial instincts to read this book. It will prepare you to help others and at the same time, survive the competition.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
This book was waiting for me in a book shop in Kolkata and found me finally. At least that's what the author Neale Donald Walsh says in the first few pages of the book. I have read his earlier book "Conversations with God". His writing style is such that he will ask many thought provoking questions, makes you think and finally leaves you confused. You need to read his text again and again to get him right. I have not got him right yet. But, you get the core message at some level. Just as I did.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"Life was meant to be happy". What a quote to start a book with!. This one line describes the context of the entire book. This book starts with the explanation of God and the perfect way for us to communion with God. Since, I am an atheist from the day I started asking questions, I could not comprehend most of the items discussed in the first few chapters. The author told, it would be the case, but I will get it in the end. Some how I was too intelligent to get the idea of God at the end. Many people claim that they understand God better after reading Donald's books. You may also get to understand God. Please read.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once he explains God, he goes on to discuss about the concept of "The Law of Attraction" which was made very popular by Rhonda Bryne in the movie "The Secret". He claims that the manifestation process taught by the new age spiritual teachers reveals only the half of the Unspoken Truth. Then he reveals "The Process of Personal Creation" - a larger, revised version of the law of attraction. Life expresses itself through.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. The Energy Of Attraction&lt;br /&gt;
2. The Law Of Opposites&lt;br /&gt;
3. The Gift Of Wisdom&lt;br /&gt;
4. The Joy Of Wonder&lt;br /&gt;
5. The Presence Of Cycles.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Good read. Too big to explain in a short review of this book. If you liked "The Secret", you will like this book as well,&amp;nbsp; but it would be contradictory and confusing for you. Be prepared. The next few chapters are dedicated to this Process of Personal Creation. What to do and what not to do etc. He ends the books with 17 steps to being happier than God, which I absolutely love.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
1. Bring an end to Separation Theology&lt;br /&gt;
2. Stay in touch with who you are&lt;br /&gt;
3. Give others every experience you seek&lt;br /&gt;
4. Be clear that nothing you see is real&lt;br /&gt;
5. Decide that you are not your story&lt;br /&gt;
6. Have only preferences&lt;br /&gt;
7. See the perfection&lt;br /&gt;
8. Bypass the drama&lt;br /&gt;
9. Understand sadness&lt;br /&gt;
10. Stop arguing with life&lt;br /&gt;
11. Drop all expectations&lt;br /&gt;
12. Have compassion for yourself&lt;br /&gt;
13. Speak your truth as soon as you know it&lt;br /&gt;
14. Watch the energies, catch the vibe&lt;br /&gt;
15. Smile&lt;br /&gt;
16. Sing&lt;br /&gt;
17. Know what to do when things are really bad&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Some of these may not make sense at first. If you read the explanations, you would agree. Its is true that you will feel happier after reading this book. I closed this book with a smile on my face. I wish you should have similar experience. Order the book now !!!&lt;br /&gt;

I got this book as a birthday gift from a friend. I really don't have a clue, how my friends know exactly what I want. Thanks a lot to all my lovely friends.&amp;nbsp;I like listening to speeches by great men. When I was in Florida during the 2008 presidential campaign, I followed each and every speech by Barack Obama. He inspired me very much. I want to become the best orator and with my speech I want to bring the best out of every human and spread love. There are many books available with similar titles, collection of great speeches by great men. This is one among them and is a collection of 42 speeches in English, arranged in chronological order.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I would call any book as a good book, if leaves an impact on you, if it changes your perception about something, if it stays in your memory for a long time, if you feel bad that the book is over and if you want to read it again and again. Surprisingly this book does everything. I cannot contribute all to the author Edward Humphreys, because he just collected all the speeches and put together in one single book. But, definitely my thanks to him for his effort.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book includes speeches by the Kings, Queens, Pastors, Political Leaders, Red Indians, Black Women, Non Political Leaders etc.&amp;nbsp;Remember, every speech in this book is made for a specific purpose at a specific time in history for a specific set of people.&amp;nbsp;If you read all the speeches, you can differentiate between the speeches that withstand time and the ones which does not. The speeches once considered as the best, does not appear best to me. Its looks very normal. So, what makes the difference?. What are the components of the speech that makes it withstand time?. Is it the emotional quotient?. Is it the plain simple facts delivered in straight forward way?. Is it the eloquent usage of words?. Is it just the man behind the mike and his reputation?. Is it the power of the speaker that takes the reader back to the history?. Or Is it because the reader can relate himself to the speech?. I do not know now. But I will definitely find out.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I do not know many people in this book. Glad to know them now. Let me give you a gist of the speeches in this book.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Elizabeth I - The Golden Speech.&lt;/b&gt; This speech is considered one of the greatest of all English Monarch. I opened the book with lots of curiosity, but you know what?. I was disappointed. I expected a speech that shows power and authority, but its very humble and down to earth. Like a sermon from a pastor. Sucks !&lt;br /&gt;
But If you read Margaret Thatcher's speech "The Lady's Not For Turning", you can feel the power, command and authority in it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;James Wolfe - Speech Before The Battle Of The Plains Of Abraham.&lt;/b&gt; - The man who brought about the end of New France. "&lt;i&gt;The impossibility of retreat makes no difference in the situation of men resolved to conquer or die; and, believe me friends, if your conquest be bought with the blood of your general, he would most cheerfully resign a life which he has long devoted to his country&lt;/i&gt;". He died and won the battle. Very inspiring.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Patrick Henry - Give Me Liberty Or Give Me Death&lt;/b&gt; - This man and his speech started the American Revolutionary War. "&lt;i&gt;Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be bought at the price of chains and slavery?. Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but for me, give me liberty, or give me death!&amp;nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;". Each and every line is inspiring.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Tecumseh&lt;/b&gt; - The Shawnee Chief, challenging the Treaty of Fort Wayne in 1810. "&lt;i&gt;Sell a Country! Why not sell the air, the clouds and the Great Sea, as well as the earth?. Did not the Great Good Spirit make them all for the use of his children? &lt;/i&gt;". Thought provoking speech from a Red Indian, which shows the ugly face of the origin of America.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Sojourner Truth - Ain't I a woman?&lt;/b&gt; - This small speech by a former black slave at the two day Convention devoted to the rights of woman, is very emotional. Not any facts, Not any wisdom. Just the plain emotional venting of years of torture and slavery. But, one of the best !&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

A little book with a little story. What's so special in this book, that it sold for more than 26 million copies and still being printed?. I knew this book almost 6 years back. I was not that much into reading back then. But, when I saw this book again in the library after so many years, I felt like the book voluntarily re-appeared in my life for a purpose, may be a message that I need it very badly. Sounds very silly, that too from an atheist. But that's what I felt for true. I started reading to figure out what it has for me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The story is simple. There is a maze with cheeses stored somewhere and four characters. Two mice, "Sniff" &amp;amp; "Scurry" and two little men "Hem" and "Haw". All of them starts their day looking for cheese. All four characters are different.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sniff - Who sniffs out changes early&lt;br /&gt;
Scurry - Who jumps into action no matter what (no hesitation)&lt;br /&gt;
Hem - Who denies and resists the change all the time&lt;br /&gt;
Haw - Who learns to adapt to the change.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
One fine day, there is no cheese and all four have to venture into the unknown (the maze) to find new cheese. How these four characters react to that change?. End of story. A story as simple as a bedtime story to a kid. The baseline of the story is that "Change" is good in all walks of life. So, enjoy the journey into the unknown (life).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But, whats so unique in this story is the characterization. We, everyone of us falls into one of these four characters or a mix of these characters in different areas of life. When the story unfolds, we get a lot of inspirational quotes from the author. In one instance, Hem says "&lt;b&gt;I want my &lt;i&gt;own&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;b&gt;Cheese back and I am not going to change, until I get what I want&lt;/b&gt;" even when she knows that there is no cheese in store.The one meant for me is this...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;The Quicker You Let Go Of Old Cheese, The Sooner You Can Enjoy New Cheese&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I read out loud those words. Many times in our life, we hold on to some relationships, jobs, situations etc which doesn't make us happy anymore or sometimes doesn't even belong to us. Moving on to the next, adventuring through the unknown territory is what keeps us alive. I learnt to live, today. Thanks to Spencer Johnson for his little book and big wisdom.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Reading more and more books and reasoning them, teaches me one simple lesson. Every book you read, has a message for you, if you are open to learn them.Many critics tells that this is just a simple story and people are very mad about this. Understand this please, its not the story which changes the readers life, its the individual's interpretation that causes the impact.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, read this little book. If you get something out of this, Great. Else, read more books :)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;div&gt;
The Greatness Guide - 101 short essays and stories to inspire you and help you&amp;nbsp;achieve&amp;nbsp;your greatness in all walks of your life. This book is slightly different from his other books. This is a collection of essays and event that happened in Robin's life, written in different periods and at different places, put together in one book for us. I don't know what to mention in the review and what to leave. If I had to write a perfect review for this book, I have to reprint the book's content here. He reiterates the importance of leading without a title in this book as well.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Here are few of my&amp;nbsp;favorites&amp;nbsp;from his book.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
* Reading a book by someone you respect allows some of their brilliance to rub off on you. - He stresses the importance of reading habit. Its one of the best discipline. I knew the benefit of this habit by experience. Guys - Please read.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
* Leadership begins on the extra mile.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
* Focus + Daily Improvement + Time = Genius&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
* Every time you say YES to something unimportant, you say NO to something that is important.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
* Challenge serves beautifully to introduce you to your best and the brilliant self.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
* If you think something cannot occur in your life, there is no way you will take the action required to make that goal a reality. Your "impossibility thinking" manifests itself.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
* Being a leader isn't about being liked. It's about doing what's right.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
* You are here to find that cause, that vital destiny that will move you at the most visceral level and get you up at the crack of dawn with fire in your belly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
* Your schedule is the best barometer for what you truly value and believe to be important. - Your schedule doesn't lie.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
* Try not to teach your fears to your kids. Introduce them to what's possible.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
* This world was built by people who felt some discontent with the way things were and knew they could do better.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
* Top athletes know that PRACTICE gets you to greatness.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
* Be outrageously energetic and madly alive - I like the concept of being wildly enthusiastic.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
* The two Magic words - Thank You. Loved this chapter on appreciating others help.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
* The words you use influence the life you live. Select them wisely.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
* I want the experience of an old man, while I'm still young. Collapse the timeline - nice ideas in this chapter.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
* Join the 5 O'Clock Club. Get up early. - I guess, I am winning the battle with my bed. :)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
* Good health is like a crown on the head of a well person that only a sick person can see. - 100% true. Exercise regularly.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
* Greatness arrives for those who are never satisfied with what is, no matter how nice it looks.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
* Everyone is a leader. But not everyone is the same. - Yes. Know your role and perform it to the perfection.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
* Give out what you most want to come back. - The concepts were different. Read it&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
* Commit to first class. Never settle for anything less.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
* Delete what needs to be eliminated from your life. You will feel lighter, happier and you mind will experience more peace.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
* What happened to "Please"?. Good manners are a stepping stone to being a remarkable human being.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
* Life tests the big dreamers - the passionate revolutionaries - Don't give up.&lt;br /&gt;
* Do a "101 things to do before I die" list. - I started preparing mine. What about you?.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
I actually wanted to list down my favorite chapter, but ended up writing almost all. I took a lot of time to delete many of them from the list, just to give you a glimpse of the book. Trust me, this book is packed with much more wisdom that I listed here. Start the winning habit. Start reading. Grab this book.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
I generally read books on human psychology, self improvements, philosophy etc and refrain from reading novels. I don't intend to avoid novels, just that I give importance to other genres. "The Story Of An Unreasonable Man" from Madhav Mathur is exceptionally fast paced. I liked the writing style. He used a rich vocabulary throughout this book, which I do not expect in a novel. However, you will get used to it in the first few chapters.&amp;nbsp;Thanks to Sumit for introducing Madhav Mathur to me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When I started the novel, I felt this is gonna be like "The White Tiger", a negative poverty seller kind. But it is not. The story line is different and well framed. This Novel is about a guy named "Pranav Kumar" who doesn't like the way things are and want to change the way the world operates. He decides that he could no more sell soaps, just for the sake of selling and quits his highly paid marketing executive job. He tries to get published and wanted to change the world with his pen, but the publishers didn't mind him. When all the doors are closed, he teams up with his friends and comes up with novel ways to get his messages across the country, shakes the world and be heard as "The Anarchists of Mumbai". Read the novel to witness the action.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
We had seen similar stories in couple of movies, but this one different in terms of non-violence. Madhav has pointed out few of the social issues in his novel. Great. However, I do not agree with all of them. I have a complete opposite idea when he discusses about marketing, cars, fashion shows etc. So, may be your thoughts. I do not understand why he chose the word Anarchist, when none of his actions are against the state/country. His actions were against the people who are lame, indisciplined. Anarchism as a concept may hold good for a small society or tribes living in remote forests. But, for a country with more than a billion citizens, I doubt. That's a whole big discussion on itself. Lets not get into it now.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Overall, its a good novel to read in a weekend. I think you can finish the novel in one stretch. Madhav Mathur has made to my list of favourite authors. Congrats Madhav !!!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Finally I found THE BOOK for the programmers. I would call this book 'A Programmer's Bible'. I suggested to procure multiple copies of this book in TCS library. This book has invaluable wisdom accumulated by Paul H. Harkins over 4 decades of his corporate&amp;nbsp;career in&amp;nbsp;programming. Even though it has serious concepts, it reads like a collection of small stories, his experiences, the situations he encountered, his colleagues etc. You wouldn't get bored even in a single chapter. This guy is programming from the dawn of the computers. Mainly into RPG. Most of the java/other technology developers out there can take the message out of this book's examples and apply it to their respective streams.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is divided into four sections, each deals with a specific purpose. The target audience of this book are from the freshers to the veterans in the top of their career hierarchy. The best part is that, every chapter has a summary at the end. If you are too busy to read a book, you could just flip through the "Bottom Line" summary at the end of each chapter.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Section 1: Starting a Successful Programming Career&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;This section is for the beginning programmers/freshers. Harkin advices the freshers on how to tackle the interview, what questions to ask, how to behave with the managers, how to learn and develop the coding skills, the importance of having the complete business process knowledge, using the borrowed code and the usage of productivity tools. Tight packed wisdom, which took close to 6 years for me to learn on my own, is presented in this first section. I am glad that I knew most of the tips in this section by experience.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Section 2: Thriving in a Competitive Environment&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;This section is for the programmers with few years of experience like me. Many programmers I knew gets&amp;nbsp;frustrated&amp;nbsp;with their work after few years and they begin to slog. Harkin tells us, how to avoid that pitfall and if we are already in to it, how to get out of that. Lots of practical advices on tackling a tough and high&amp;nbsp;visibility&amp;nbsp;projects, boosting your performance, handling stress, tips and tricks to master complex applications and business processes etc. He suggests us to keep changing the projects, spotting and utilizing the&amp;nbsp;opportunities&amp;nbsp;and how to stay at the top of our game. I enjoyed these chapters more, as I could relate to these text !&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Section 3: Mastering the Corporate Culture&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; Harkin stresses the importance of having a mentor in your organization and encourages you to mentor others too. I liked this and I am doing this often. His tips on how to get adjusted to the corporate culture of the new company, how to get along with your boss, what to do If you get a bad boss and how to get a push in your pay check are really good. However, I do not agree with some of the concepts that he discusses in the name of corporate culture, to keep your manager happy. I find myself in trouble, time and again, just because I couldn't do it. I would not blame anyone at the same time I don't agree with some of the concepts discussed in this section.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;Also, he stresses that a private office and a silent workplace is a must for efficient programming. I completely disagree. I cannot work in silence. Over the years in many different projects, I have observed that I perform efficiently in a most noisiest place with a lot of distractions from people around me. When I am alone, I do, may be quarter of my work. He should have put a disclaimer that it applies to him and may apply to others as well. Not as a mandatory one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Section 4: Beyond programming&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;This section is for the programmers with an entrepreneurial&amp;nbsp;bent. Mostly discusses on how to become a programming consultant, pros and cons of that career and how to develop your own company and market your own software product etc. He urges the importance of writing for the industry that you are working for. I like it very much. He sited examples of people shifting from programming to corporate positions in an interesting manner.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even though this book targets four different categories of programmers, I would suggest everyone to read every chapter. Since I feel thats a logical career path for achieving programmers, unless you already planned your career path. This book has made a lasting impression on me and forced me to make some decisions in my life, which I would not have taken other wise. I am planning to blog on the mobile development arena. Thanks a lot Paul H. Harkins for writing this book for us.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Language:&lt;/b&gt; English&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ryuho Okawa is the founder of "Happy Science" - an organisation or religion which aims to achieve the true happiness, based on the teachings of the author. He claims himself as the spiritual leader, in many places throughout the book. For a while, I was reading only exceptionally good and interesting books, till I come across this one. This book reads like a school text book, which primarily aims at the school children in Japan. But the description of the book in the outer cover was misleading that its for general audience and its mentioned that 20 million copies of his books were sold so far. No questions the numbers anyway, just like me.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Never judge a book by its cover - Don't know who said it, but its true. Ok, lets plunge into the book and see a gist of what the author said to the world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is divided into five chapters and the first one is about the friendship. Okawa claims that the friendship wont last longer, if you are very much attached to the other person. He asks us to play safe, like playing cards, releasing one card at a time. He suggests to keep distance always. I couldn't agree with him in this, because I enjoy ever-lasting friendships with many to whom I am very close and I never broke a relationship. Also he discusses about bullying that happens in the school and teaches the kids about the heaven, hell, evil, spirit and all the useless stuff in order to discipline them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The second chapter is about enduring setbacks. He provides a lot of alternative perspective to look at setbacks. He devoted a whole bunch of pages to explain the setbacks - full of negativity. I wanted to throw away the book, but all of a sudden he made me laugh uncontrollably. See, what he said in page 55.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"&lt;i&gt;When I spiritually checked to see where he(Masao Maruyuma) went after he died. I found out that he went not to Heaven, but to Hell&lt;/i&gt;"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Just after 10 mins, I was interested to read what other stuff the author has to say. I became curious. The third chapter is about reading books. He gives us some practical stuff &amp;amp; encourage us to read more book in wide variety of subjects. But then, he claims the below in page 87.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"&lt;i&gt;Since I was young, I have read about 1000 books per year&lt;/i&gt;". Whooh... I thought it would be close to 1000 books altogether, but he claims that its 1000 / yr. (i.e.) close to three books a day, for the entire year. I have seen this scene in a Tamil movie "Endhiran". And surprisingly everyone in Happy Science believes whatever he says. No one questions or even asks him the name of those 1000 books.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the fourth chapter, he discusses about helping others and suggests some tips (based on some assumptions) to Japanese women to excel in administrative cadre. The last chapter, "Life of Truth" is the ultimate comedy. He goes too deep into it and discusses about talking to spirits and getting guidance from them, about our different past life and six incarnations, how to stay on Truth, what may get you to Hell. It reads like Voodoo magic. He must have read extensively about African tribes and their beliefs in those 1000 books :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Overall, I wouldn't suggest this book to anyone. There are better books available in the market. If you have the patience and time to tolerate the author's humor sense and grasp the few good tips spread across the book, you can read at your own risk.

The author William Ury is a master negotiator, public speaker and a trained anthropologist. Over the past three decades, he has mediated in conflicts ranging from coal strikes, to boardroom battles to civil wars around the world. He was the part of the team, mediated the 1962 Cuban nuclear missile crisis, which had 99% possibility of becoming a nuclear world war 3 (thanks to Che Guevara - my hero) just to site an example for his credibility. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I still remember the *two words* which I said to my client in a conference call, during a heated discussion and a whole bunch of bitter stories afterwards. There were better negotiators in my team who backed me up, otherwise I would have been with a different organization now. Nevertheless, its a practical lesson. The master reveals his secrets to all of us. May be I should have read him well before. Guys, trust my words. Read him right away.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"&lt;i&gt;A 'No' uttered from the deepest conviction is better and greater than a 'Yes' merely uttered to please, or what is worse, to avoid a trouble&lt;/i&gt;" - Mahatma Gandhi&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I will try to give the excerpts from this book. Everyday we find ourselves in situations in which we need to say 'No' to people on whom we depend. When our No is confronted, all of us fall into one of these three A's.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Accommodate &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;- We say YES, when we want to say NO.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Attack &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;- We say NO poorly, the other person is hurt. That was me, most of the time. Not anymore :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Avoid &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;- We say nothing at all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ury proposes a Positive NO, which will actually make the other person to accept your NO and still maintain a healthy relationship with you. Positive NO follows this structure "Yes!. No. Yes?"&lt;br /&gt;
Confused?. Read the book. he he he.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;First Yes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - expresses your interests, uncover your needs, interests, values and reach down to the core of what you stand for. Its internally focused.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;No&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/b&gt;- asserts your power. This is something that you want to be changed. Ury proposes a variety of techniques to make your No, a very positive one.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Second Yes&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; - invitation to the others to come to an agreement that satisfies your interests as well as saves the other's face. Basically, you need to build a golden bridge to connect the canyon that your NO may create. Its externally focused on others.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Ury explains these in detail with lots of real world situations. He guides us way from preparing, delivering and following-through our Positive NO. Lots of techniques like Going to Balcony, Name the Game, Use of I-statement, we-statements, the-statements, the acceptance speech test etc. and tips to say NO effectively are explained in detail which will make sure that a mutually beneficial agreement is reached.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I would recommend this book to everyone. Five stars !!!&lt;br /&gt;

I normally get curious of ALL the books that sells more than a million copy. This one reached 25 million prints, and still goes on. I decided to find out what ticks with the readers. This book was presented to my room-mate Shanmuga on his birthday by one of our mutual Christian friend. This is a book by a Christian for other Christians. NOT for anyone else. Since Christianity and Islam runs for the biggest religion race, no wonder 25 million Christian readers bought this book. I believe 0.000001% of those books were gifted to non-Christians :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Cool... Lets get into the core of this book. What this book is all about?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The author Rick Warren wants you to sign a covenant that you will read one chapter a day for the next 40 days to discover the god's purpose for your life. I liked this. Most of the time, when we read a big book full of wisdom and knowledge, we tend to skim over few pages/chapters and at the end of the book, very few messages stay on. But, if you read one chapter at a time and think about it the whole day, you GET the message. Rick is brilliant.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I do not attribute my inabilities, weaknesses and insufficient knowledge to an entity called GOD and submit myself to him. I question a lot, never received even a single satisfactory explanation for the need or existence of god and I was termed as "atheist". This book has only commands to follow, not an explanation of why?. I know, most of the religions never allow you to question their faith. Because, if you do, there wont be any religion :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Surprisingly, the first chapter starts with a quote from an atheist, analytic philosopher Bertrand Russell. "Unless you assume a god, the question of life's purpose is meaningless". I am damn sure that Rick misunderstood the quote, otherwise he wouldn't have put this in his book. In the first chapter, Rick claims that God started everything and denied Darwinism altogether. He assumes that lot of successful people are driven by guilt, resentment, anger, fear and materialism. Pain and suffering are given by god to develop you.. he he he.. The world is a temporary assignment and your permanent life will be eternal in some unknown place... blah..blah..blah..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rick wants all the Christians to know and follow the god's five purposes.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Purpose #1:&lt;/b&gt; You were planned for God's pleasure.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; Seriously, I was excited on reading the chapter's title. But its not what I thought though. he he he. This chapter teaches how to worship god, how to make him smile, how to surrender yourself, how to become god's friend etc. The entire chapter is summarized in the below sentence (page 75). God says &lt;i&gt;"You have no right to argue with your Creator. You are merely a claypot shaped by a potter". &lt;/i&gt;Great. I actually wanted to throw away this book at this point. But thought, there should be at least few lines of good wisdom that will be applicable to the entire human population.So, went ahead...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Purpose #2:&lt;/b&gt; You were formed for God's family.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; "&lt;i&gt;Love others as you love yourselves&lt;/i&gt;". This is one of the most important teachings of Christianity that I love to even spread the message. "&lt;i&gt;No matter what I say, what I believe, and what I do, I'am bankrupt without love&lt;/i&gt;". This chapter tells us how to form relationships, love everyone (not just Christians. I likes this), why do you need church, the importance of the communities, experiencing the life together, restoring the broken fellowship and protecting the church. I would recommend even the non Christians to read this chapter. The world would be awesome &amp;amp; lovely, if everyone understands this one message.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Purpose #3:&lt;/b&gt; You were created to become like Christ.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; This chapter tells you how to grow like Christ. This chapter deals with understanding the Truth (?), handling the trouble as Jesus would (?), dealing with temptations and how to keep yourselves focused on doing good to others. Excellent work by Rick on the chapters dealing with temptations.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Purpose #4:&lt;/b&gt; You were shaped for serving god.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; You are commanded to serve like a servant, accept your weakness and request god to help you in all the troubled times. How to think and act like a servant and why you should not lead. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Purpose #5:&lt;/b&gt; You were made for a mission.&lt;br /&gt;
&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;To help (?) the god to find his lost children. To bring more people to the god, by telling the good news(?) to everyone. That's the only mission for which God created you from Clay. he he he.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If you just look at the purposes, all of them are passive &amp;amp; submissive. You are like a robot designed by god to do his will. Your job is just to do that and as a lucky bumper prize, you may get a chance to live in heaven. If you don't, you will suffer in hell forever. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If I was a God, I would have designed the world in a better way !&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book has lots of wisdom, heavily flavored in Christianity. If you have the patience and time to read the entire book and grasp only the core ideas, this book is worth the pennies.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
For Christians, this is a must read. That's what 25 million fellow Christians tell you. So, join the flock and enjoy your route to heaven. All the best !&lt;br /&gt;

"You are meant to have an amazing life"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Irish-Australian writer Rhonda Bryne, was once a producer of reality-TV shows in Australia who is now a multi-millionaire living in a Beverley Hills mansion, next door to Oprah Winfrey. She became so, with her best selling book &amp;amp; DVD, "The Secret". She comes with a sequel "The Power", which is expected to sell atleast 20 million copies, out of which 2 million copies are printed and almost sold out. So, whats in this book?. Lets do a fair, really fair review of the book.&lt;br /&gt;

"Give, and it will be given to you... for by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you in return" - Jesus.&lt;br /&gt;

"Everything is possible for the person who believes" - Jesus.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I can summarize the entire book into these four keywords. Love, Gratitude, Giving and Belief. (Which almost all religions in the world preaches). She claims that the book is complete in itself and doesn't need formal knowledge. I disagree. Lets trace back the history.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ (Kollywood style symbol for flashback :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In 2004, She was in the biggest financial crisis of her lifetime, then she got the book "The Science of getting rich" by Wallace D. Wattles which transformed her life. She wanted to tell the truth to entire world, researched the history, found a lot of information and created the DVD "The Secret" with the help of world's well known motivational speakers in 2006. She was the producer and did a pretty good job. The DVD was a phenomenal hit and the book "The Secret" is translated into 46 languages. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I was introduced to "The Law of Attraction (LOA)" through this DVD. LOA says "Like attracts like. Good, happy &amp;amp; positive feelings will attract positive people, circumstances and events and vice versa". &lt;br /&gt;
LOA comprises of the two important things&lt;br /&gt;
1. Visualizations, belief &amp;amp; feelings&lt;br /&gt;
2. ACTION.&lt;br /&gt;
The DVD doesn't talk even a word about ACTION. You CANNOT attract million dollars, just by lying in the bed and imagining. Trust me, it doesn't work, because I tried it. Even with so many stories and real life examples in the DVD, I was surprised. I thought its superstitious and doesn't work.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I like Dr. Joe Vitale &amp;amp; John Assaraf from the DVD and I still closely following them for any piece of advice. It was then, I found another audio book "The Missing Secret" by Dr. Joe Vitale which completed the puzzle, by stressing the importance of ACTION to acheive any of your dreams. Still, believing that there is something more powerful than us, doing things for us (if we just ask) doesnt make sense to me. Dr. Joe Vitale is more of a spiritual person, so I just took only the key advices from him.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Later, I found another book "The Answer" by John Assaraf - who flabbergasted me with the scientific explanations (with citations and references) about how things work in LOA. He was so clear that he explained whatever science could prove and told us clearly the portions which are under research still. Since he is a self made millionaire and entrepreneur, you can see his quest for scientific answers throughout this book. This book has initial few chapters dedicated to LOA and science and the rest of the chapters about building the dream business.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To me, Dr. Joe Vitale and John Assaraf stood as authors who actually tells the truth and Rhonda Bryne, just ignores the KEY information for the sake of better screen play in the DVD.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
End of the story. I hope now you know the background!&lt;br /&gt;
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So, I was curious whats special with this new book?. The printed book was heavy and colorful with lovely designs. The Law of Attraction was renamed as "The Law of Love". The importance of Love, Gratitude, Giving and Belief is stressed with different set of quotes from world leader, religions etc. Apart from few extra tips and techniques, there is NOTHING new in this book. May be that, she categorized how to have good health, relationships and money etc in different chapters, which is not available in "The Secret".&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
How about the writing style?. Crap. Most of the self-help books re-iterate few key points throughout the book, so that it goes deep into the reader's mind. This was used very heavily and becomes irritating so much that, I tend to skip the paragraphs. There are people who compares the "success" of this book and Harry Potter. From writer's perspective, She cannot even come close to Rowling.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Why is that a book review about a most sought after positive thinking book, sounds very negative (which is the very first thing that the author doesnt want you to do). Its because, First - I was so excited, pre-ordered the book that I am gonna get a lot of useful information and didnt find much. Second - I just want to give my honest feedback to the author, so that She can improve and to the reader, that they will know what to expect.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;To Rhonda Bryne:&lt;/b&gt; Please improve your writing style. Reduce lot of repetitive sentences. I am sure that a newbie to self-help, wouldn't understand much from this book alone. So, don't claim something which your book doesn't do.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;To the readers:&lt;/b&gt; I would suggest the following sequence, if you really want to know what's happening around.&lt;br /&gt;
1. The Secret - DVD by Rhonda Bryne&lt;br /&gt;
2. The Missing Secret - Audio book by Dr. Joe Vitale&lt;br /&gt;
3. The Answer - Book by John Assaraf&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Once you are done with these, please read "The Power" by Rhonda Bryne and I am sure you would share my thoughts. Here is one interesting review about this book. Very funny. Please read all the comments as well :)&lt;br /&gt;

Hugh Macleod is a copywriter, cartoonist, avid blogger, writer (this is his first book), CEO of Stormhoek USA, which markets South African wine in the States. I thought that this book is all about creativity. Guess, I was wrong. This book doesn't tell you, how to become creative, instead it guides you, if you are already creative, have some good ideas and don't know how to proceed with your ideas.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Hugh developed the habit of drawing in the back of the business cards with cartoons and sarcastically humorous content, while he was waiting for his date, in the NYC bars. He started a blog gapingvoid.com and started publishing these business card cartoons. He has opinion on everything that you can think about. This book is nothing but selected 39 blogs from his website. You can read all of them in his website.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you have an idea or a business plan or an art form, which is completely unique and different from the rest of the world's thinking, this is THE BOOK that you may need to read. The author guides you step by step, explains you the probable mental states that you may have to go through and the probable people that you may have to work with. He uses a lot of real-life examples to explain. This is basically a guide for you, to protect your creativity and still enjoy it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
All these blogs are based on his experience (bitter/good) in NYC as a copywriter and by observing his colleagues and friends etc. Most of the blogs are funny and good. I couldn't agree with some of them.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Few of my favorite blogs/chapters from this book are :&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;* Ignore everybody&lt;/b&gt; - not in the real physical sense. Just that, great ideas alter the power balance relationship and are always initially resisted. So, if you really think that your idea is worth pursuing, just ignore everybody (including your loved ones)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;* Everyone is born creative&lt;/b&gt; - Everybody is given a box of crayons in the Kindergarten. But as we grew, the crayons were replaced with possibly un-inspiring algebra, history, politics etc (** Many people love these subjects). Every now and then, you may hear a wee voice inside your head "I want my crayon please". But we are too busy with our mundane task, that we don't listen. Just listen!!!.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;* Everybody has their own private Mount Everest they were put on this earth to climb.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;* Dont worry about finding inspiration. It comes eventually.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;* Power is never given. Power is taken.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I wont suggest that this is a must-read. But its worth casual read on the weekends. Who knows, you may pickup your crayons, after this book. Just try it !!!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Book:&lt;/b&gt; The Dolphin - Story Of A Dreamer&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Author:&lt;/b&gt; Sergio Bambaren, Michele&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;ISBN:&lt;/b&gt; 9380480046&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Binding:&lt;/b&gt; Paperback&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Publisher:&lt;/b&gt; Hay House&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Dolphin, I saw this book in TCS library. #1 International Best Seller. More than 10 Million Copies sold world wide!!!. I became curious. What made this book to sell 10M copies???...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Its a story about a young dolphin, Daniel Alexander Dolphin - who has a dream. A dream to ride the perfect wave in the sea. As soon as I read the first few pages, I couldn't help myself - not to think about "Jonathan Livingston Seagull". I felt that this dolphin is the same story told with a different character.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I did a small comparison between both the books. Please remember "Jonathan Livingston Seagull" was published in 1970 and "The Dolphin" in 1996.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
JLS: Hero is a seagull&lt;br /&gt;
TD: Hero is a dolphin&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
JLS: Seagull has a dream to master the art of flying and break the rules of the flock.&lt;br /&gt;
TD: Dolphin has a dream to master the art of surfing and ride the perfect wave and break the rules of the pod.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
JLS: Seagull leaves the flock and ventured into the unknown distances over the ocean.&lt;br /&gt;
TD: Dolphin leaves the pod and travels across the vast ocean with no direction.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
JLS: Seagull meets a lot of birds enroute and gets wisdom and directions.&lt;br /&gt;
TD: Dolphin meets a lot of fishes enroute and gets wisdom and directions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
JLS: Seagull fulfills his dream, comes to the flock and enlightens others&lt;br /&gt;
TD: Dolphin fulfills his dream, comes to the pod and enlightens others&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
JLS: Seagull disappears into heaven in the end.&lt;br /&gt;
TD: Dolphin disappears miraculously in the end.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Both the books has a lot of inspirational quotes scattered across story and implies the same idea - "Follow your dream, no matter what"&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the book, "The Dolphin" I could also sense the impact of "The Alchemist" which was published couple of decades before this book. If you have not read the other two books, I strongly recommend you to read this book. This would inspire you to follow your dreams. But, if you have already read the other book, this is just redundant information. It would be a funny idea to read both the books one after another.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sergio - Don't mistake me. This could be your authentic idea. But it was published already. I know you have written few other books. I will give my real feedback after those books ;)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I have read the reviews for this book, many people found this very spiritual and inspiring. Why don't you guys try it?.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;ISBN-13: &lt;/b&gt;9780470345030&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Binding: &lt;/b&gt;Hardcover&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Publishing Year: &lt;/b&gt;Oct 2008&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Publisher: &lt;/b&gt;Jossey-bass&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Number of Pages: &lt;/b&gt;210&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Language: &lt;/b&gt;English&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I buy most of the books through recommendations from authors, references from books, websites, word of mouth etc. I buy some books on an instinct, just by flipping through few pages. This is one of them. The title &amp;amp; the cover picture implied adventure and praise from Ken Blanchard (author of One Minute Manager) made this book to my library.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Chris is a vivid mountaineer who is one of the nine American's who summitted world's two tallest mountains Mt. Everest and K2. Don is a scientist and engineer who pioneered fourth generation medical imaging technology and researched on simulating timing systems for navy's nuclear missile systems. They both write a book on management &amp;amp; leadership?. Sounded crazy and started flipping immediately!. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The book starts with Dead Zone Leadership.  Dead Zone - an altitude above 26,000 feet makes survival for a long period impossible. Only the highest performing team survives these extreme altitudes. These climbers resemble entrepreneurs, CEOs and the dead zone, a perfect back drop for the tough times these CEO's go through regularly. Chris &amp;amp; Don postulates the high altitude leadership based on their first hand experience in the dead zone.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I felt like watching NGC, when Chris describes the events happened during the expeditions to various mountains and the behavior of the climbers. He is so good in narrating his own experiences and those pages moves super fast.  Most of the management and leadership books will be on the positive side, but this is different. This book just list down the negatives and dangers that you should be aware of, rather than the positive side. This made a little noise in my mind as my idea is completely opposite. Here are the list of dangers that Chris and Don warns us.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Danger #1: Fear of Death&lt;/b&gt; What would the climbers do, when they stuck in avalanche?. Stand still or run sideways for support?. That is idea. Don't let the tough time paralyze the organization, instead act decisively and early.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Danger #2: Selfishness&lt;/b&gt; Blaming others, backstabbing, political maneuvering, looking good to the boss, passing the buck, grin faking are some of the DUD behaviors (Dangerous, Unproductive &amp;amp; Dysfunctional) root on selfishness. No organization in the world escapes DUD infection. DUD behavior eats profits and make work less satisfying. Chris suggests that the organizations should have a compelling saga, which will inspire the employee to come to work on a daily basis. Not just the vision, mission &amp;amp; values statement printed &amp;amp; hung in the walls. Saga must be crafted such a way that the lowest employee in the organization understands that exactly like the CEO.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Danger #3: Tool Seduction&lt;/b&gt; When the organization grows bigger, we tend to use new tools and  introduce new process to achieve our primary goals faster. But over the course of time, the organization tend to give so much of importance to the processes and tools, to an extent that the project halts without them. The company I work with now, is a great example. Adapt your tools to you, based on the conditions and not vice versa. This is a problem only when the processes takes precedence over the main objective of the company. Otherwise, its a must for every company.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Danger #4: Arrogance&lt;/b&gt; Arrogance occurs when overconfidence infects you. You become the know-it-all guy, who ignores or chastise others, spend more time trying to be right vs finding solutions. The solid teams grow stronger when humbled; weak ones become more dysfunctional. Crafting an arrogant-free culture takes work, but its worth the effort. Humility should improve the judgment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Danger #5: Lone Heroism&lt;/b&gt; Ego driven, selfish, glory-seeking lone heroism, which put others at risk is very dangerous and may lead to manager fragging. Ask for help, when you need it. Work as a team to conquer the challenge in front of us. Chris is not referring the surreal attempts by brave souls against the mediocre odd. Thats personal and everyone must do it frequently to keep our spirit alive.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Danger #6: Cowardice&lt;/b&gt; Cowardice equally damages the organizations as lone heroism. Just ask &amp;amp; challenge yourself. Nothing wrong in being perceived as a weak person, if that's the truth. Keep doing it, sooner than you imagine, you will be the bravest one in the organization.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Danger #7: Comfort&lt;/b&gt; I am still seeing people in my current company, doing  the same work year after year, not because they love the job, but they are very comfortable doing that. The moment you feel that you are very comfortable is the right moment to change. Most of these people become dead weight to the company sooner or later. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Danger #8: Gravity&lt;/b&gt; This is the chapter that I contradict with authors views. Chris was saved miraculously in couple of moments in different climbing expeditions from avalanche's and crevasses. (Very interesting, real life story). This created a strong influence of luck in his thoughts. He even goes on to differentiate skill-based luck and pure luck. I'll let you guys to read his book and understand this chapter, since I already have a biased thoughts on this subject.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Few of the concepts discussed in the book are extremely opposite. Like - Fear of Death and Arrogance, Lone Heroism and cowardice. There is a silver line between these concepts, which could have been handled more efficiently. Many times these overlaps and I actually went back re-read the chapters to understand.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
If your organization/team is in trouble and you need immediate help, please don't buy this book alone. This book is written in such a style that it hammers your thought with outright truth. You may not comprehend, if your mind is not open. Worth reading !!!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Language:&lt;/b&gt; English &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is a sequel to "Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish" from our own local author Rashmi Bansal. The awesome stories of 20 individuals who made it big in the business with out an MBA. Each story is so compelling that you cannot put the book down, without completing it. Also, the pace of the book is amazing. You can finish this book faster than you could think of. Rashmi is gifted with such an interesting conversational writing style.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is very much needed at this time to inspire and create more entrepreneurs. "If they can do it, why not me?". That's the question that comes to your mind after reading each story. The very first story is about Prem Ganapathy, who went to Mumbai without even a rupee, but established "Dosa Plaza" - the most popular food chain in Mumbai. This book is not just about IT success stories, it has wide variety of stories. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
There are stories about the guy who invented 100KW inverter, the guy who started VETA to teach english, a house-wife who started with facial bleach, went on to create Fem Care Pharma, about LaserSoft, a cityboy interested in making Cheese, Chetan who created REVA cars, a lady who creates papers from elephant poo, about a film director Paresh, Krishna reddy from "Prince Dance Group" and my favorite photographer Kalyan Verma. I would rate this book 100% better than the previous one of this kind. That's what each author looks for in every books right?. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rashmi - you succeeded in that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To tell the truth, "Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish" - her previous book is about 20 individuals with an MBA from IIM-A. Their stories were awesome, but somehow I had a feeling that they have an insurance in the form of MBA from IIM-A. Even if they fail, they will get a very comfortable job. But this book is very inspiring. This is just about individuals from every walk of life. Those who had money and those dont. Those who had formal education and those who never been to school. It represents India in its entirety. Indian entrepreneurs need this exposure very much, so that the rest of the world understand that India lives not only on IT and the scraps from services, but on every field. This book tells us that we are the pioneers in lot of less known fields.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I must tell you this. I actually picked up this book, just because it had a story about my favorite photographer Kalyan Verma. There are couple of stories in this book, which made me cry. The story of a dancer Krishna Reddy - who created the dance group with the daily wage labors and won the prize in "India's got talent". Check out his masterpieces in youtube. Search for "Prince Dance Group". The second one is about Suresh Kamanth - who created Lasersoft and employed non-engineers, taught them programming and made it big. Very impressive fact is that he employs physically challenged poeple. Would you think about working with a colleague who is deaf and dumb?. Would you teach the rest of your employee, the sign-language, so they can interact with them?. Would you proudly tell that you have % of people who are physically challenged in one way or other?. He did it. I am very proud that I am sharing the same time-period with this awesome man.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Rashmi - I have a serious feedback to you. Your writing style is awesome. But its a horrible mix of English and Hindi. Very horrible. I have no idea of any word in Hindi. You are a famous writer now and please target your audience now. Those are not just Hindi speaking people. Please get the language straight.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Guys - Its a must read for everyone.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
Should I really write a review for Robin Sharma's book?. His name stands better than the best book-review anyone could write for his book. Hmm... let me share some of the insights that are spread throughout this book. This book packs 15 yrs of his leadership advisory experience, which was once a closely guarded secret. Robin tried to make this book interesting by using the story of an Iraq war vet Blake Davis.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Blake served in Iraq war and is having tough time transitioning to civilian life. He is having trouble with the relationships and job. Tommy, his father's friend comes to his life and introduces him the philosophy of "LWT - Lead Without a Title". Blake gets introduced to four different teachers and learns the philosophy with atmost interest. Transformation of Blake from playing victim-hood to leading is described very naturally. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is packed with a hell lot of quotes from well known personalities all over the world. Some of the quotes from Robin are awesome. Lots of acronyms are used and lots of repetition to instill these concepts in reader's mind. Robin Sharma summarizes the philosophy under four different principles, taught by four different teachers. The teachers Anna, Ty, Jackson &amp;amp; Jet are striking different from each other, but follows the same principle.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I would like to give a glimpse of these four principle, but suggest you to read the book to grasp it completely.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Principle 1: You need no title to be a leader.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Leadership is not reserved to the selected few who lead the organizations or the countries. Everyone has the power and potential to lead by example. You need to be very innovative and be a master at whatever you do. Be it street sweeping or an exquisite art work of calibrating diamonds or a CEO. Be a master of it. Be authentic and have guts to take difficult decisions when the rest of the world hides in the cocoon. You should have you own value systems or ethics to guide you along your route.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Principle 2: Turbulent times build great leaders.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Remember the old quote, "Smooth seas never make a skilled sailor". But how often, do we remember this?. Robin sharma devotes more pages to this principle than the rest and pushes the principle into our mind, without us realizing it. Its good. "Life begins at the end of the comfort zone". Lets celebrate the tough time with a big smile :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Principle 3: The deeper your relationship, the stronger your leadership.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
I cannot emphasize the importance of this principle in our life. Be it, professional or personal , relationships are very very important. DON'T break any relationship in your life, whatever the reason are. At the end of the life - money, power, position, college degree doesn't matter. Its the fulfilling relationships that you have earned, matters. So, go for it. Just mingle with everyone, have fun. Thats what we are all here for !!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Principle 4: To be a great leader, first become a great person.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
This principle details about the personal life of a leader. The importance needs to be given for the personal health, family, friends, fun-time and self-realization. Robin Sharma gives seven essential steps to become a great person.&lt;br /&gt;
1. Learning&lt;br /&gt;
2. Affirmations&lt;br /&gt;
3. Visualization&lt;br /&gt;
4. Journaling&lt;br /&gt;
5. Goal setting&lt;br /&gt;
6. Exercise&lt;br /&gt;
7. Nutrition&lt;br /&gt;
I am doing most of these &amp;amp; I know the importance of these first hand. Please try and transform.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Title: &lt;/b&gt;The 4-Hour Workweek&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Author: &lt;/b&gt;Timothy Ferriss&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Hardcover: &lt;/b&gt;416 pages&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Publisher: &lt;/b&gt;Crown; Exp Upd edition (December 15, 2009)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Language: &lt;/b&gt;English&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;ISBN-10: &lt;/b&gt;0307465357&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;ISBN-13: &lt;/b&gt;978-0307465351&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"The 4-hour work week - Escape the 9-5, live anywhere and join the new rich." The book, which transformed few of my beliefs, addressed the fears that I had in me, without me knowing that. Tim painted new colors in my dream picture, with his own and I love it.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This book is constructed into 4 major groups - DEAL - (Definition, Elimination,Automation &amp;amp; Liberation) with multiple chapters. Many chapters end with Q&amp;amp;A. I would suggest you to take time to answer those questions. If you just flip through the pages, without associating your own life, I doubt this book will make any difference, other than leaving you in surprise. The book begins with the definition of the "New Rich" and Tim's real life story.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In the first group D - Definition, the author discusses about the differences between the NR and others, identifying the goals and introduces Dreamline and TMI. "The fat man in the red BMW convertible" - this metaphor made me think a lot. Thats what most of the ultra-successfull millionaires look like. I do not have the slightest interest to become one of them. The comfort challenges like eyegazing, proposing, getting phone numbers etc are really good. I even suggested them to my friend and he is happy. (I do that already, so did need it)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The second group E - Elimination is what I would suggest everyone to read. Even if you love to work more than 8 hrs a day, these simple tips and techniques will help you to perform better. The 80/20 principle and the parkinson's law are explained with live examples. Tips on selective ignorance and time management are excellent. For ex. The number of times, you check emails on a busy day and the time you lose with interruption those emails brings is directly propotional. I started checking emails only few times in a day and close "Lotus Notes" (Email client) as soon as I am done with reading emails. You won't believe, it looks very simple, but very productive. The emails which I use to respond immediately were not that urgent, than the things that I was doing.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The third group A - Automation. Introduced a lot of new things. Outsourcing your day to day mundane activities to a virtual assistant is completely new to me and I am gonna hire a VA for me :) The idea of separating income from your time spent is really required for having a mobile lifestyle. Since the author followed the path of the entreprenour, he discloses all the tips and tricks of marketing, products, afffiliations, royalty, licensing etc. But mine is a different ball game related to creativity, so these chapters took a little more time to complete.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The last group L - Liberation. Starts with the tips on how to escape from the office. ha ha ha ah.. no.. not in the way you think. Instead of working for 30 - 45 years and planning for a retirement, the author suggests mini-retirements of three to six months, which is completely practical and wil give you a glimpse of how your retirement will feel like. After one mini-retirement, your perception about retirements will definetly change and you are still young to change the decisions ;). He provides the practical tips &amp;amp; step by step instructions for your mini-retirements and a tour around the world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The in last few "Restricted Reading" chapters, the author lists down the books, resources that you will need for a vagabonding life. This book packed more information that It could possibly include. It was a very pleasure experience reading a book like this. Try it :)&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;b&gt;Title: &lt;/b&gt;Human Minds - An Exploration&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Author: &lt;/b&gt;Margaret Donaldson&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Paperback: &lt;/b&gt;320 pages&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Publisher: &lt;/b&gt;Penguin (Non-Classics) (December 1, 1993)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;Language: &lt;/b&gt;English&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;ISBN-10: &lt;/b&gt;0140170332&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;ISBN-13: &lt;/b&gt;978-0140170337&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Margaret Donaldson is Emeritus Professor of Developmental Psychology at the University of Edinburgh. In this book, she discusses in detail about the development of the human brain from childhood. She defines and explains the four important modes in which our brain develops and functions. Point-mode, Line-mode, Construct-mode and Transcendent-mode with lots of research data from the well known scientists in this field.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even though this book reads like a text-book of Psycho-analysis field, she hooks you up into this book very easily. Since the first section of the book deals with the development of the children brain, lots of case-studies about the children spread over this book. Anything related to kids must be interesting. (No excuses, even if its a text-book).&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
She details the modes of our brain, with precise data and the time-lines. Ex. The child brain will be in Point-mode till the eighth month approx and then it transcends to Line-Mode for next three years. During these period, how the child will behave and how his/her brain can be trained to develop into its full capacity, are explained. It gave me meaningful information on kids brain, which every parent must know. I thank her for that.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
So far, so good. Till the interval...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The second section of the book deals with the brains functionality when its mature. (i.e. adult's brain). Margaret tried to explain through the medium which she is not comfortable with. She touches few religions - Hinduism, Christianity, Buddhism, Judaism, Muslim etc to explain, how the brain switches the mode when dealing with emotions and raw information.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I feel that the author drifted away from what I expected from the book and tried to explain the things which she may not understand fully (with a disclaimer, of-course). She went on to explain the "self-realization" in various religions with respect to modes of the brain. One good thing is that she doesn't conclude anything, instead she puts them as questions, back to us. So, if you know that specific religion, the text will make sense to you.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I felt that I am in Margaret's class on Human Minds rather than reading a book. The writing style could be improved, avoiding long sentences and with proper punctuation. If you have the habit of reading out loud, then you will gasp for oxygen, while reading :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Overall, I am happy that I came to know a lot about the human brain development. I would suggest you to read the first half of the book. The second half is your choice.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Let me know, if this review is helpful !!!&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;
"What a beautiful day!.." - A Song from rock band U2 kept playing in my mind, when I sit in a comfy sofa and wander what to do next. This is not new for me, I do this very often. Somehow today, I felt like Tom Hanks in "Cast Away". Yeah.. really.. What do you call a guy who is wearing a week old dirty lungi and a brand new yellow colour Reebok T-Shirt supporting "Chennai Super Kings", has not brushed till 10.30 AM, has no wallet, has no mobile phone, and hungry?. Hmm.. that's me, today March 24, 2010.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Last night I was reading a book "Give to Live", way past 1 AM and didn't realise when I slept. A facebook SMS message from Sean Stephenson, switched off my Dream Channel, when I was romancing with my angel.&amp;nbsp; "&lt;i style="font-family: Georgia,&amp;quot;Times New Roman&amp;quot;,serif;"&gt;There's a big difference between "caring about" versus "caring for" someone. One is passive and one is active.&lt;/i&gt;"&amp;nbsp; I didn'treally understand the message. I was in the process of waking up, sometimes that stretches up to 4-5 hrs after sunrise. I enjoy every minute of that process and they labelled me "lazy". I don't understand this... When a Chinese monk told them to drink tea slowly and enjoy the act of drinking, they made a ritual out of it. When I told them to wake up slowly and enjoy the act of waking up, the response is @#$%^*. Crazy world !.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I called up Sofia. My first act on any normal day and she didn't pick up the phone. Then her better half Haja came online.&lt;br /&gt;
"Kavinjare, epdi irukeenga", said Haja.&lt;br /&gt;
"Super, Neenga epdi irukeenga"&lt;br /&gt;
"Nalla iruken. Naanum oru kavithai ezhuthi iruken.. Nila.. Vaanam.. ~!@#$% ^&amp;amp;*~*. Aana ava kizhichi pottuta"&lt;br /&gt;
"He he he... Kavithai - unga unarchigaloda vari vadivam. Force panna varaathu", I smiled at what I just said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I put on the T-shirt, took the clothes to be washed and went to Sofia's home. Whooh... She was too gorgeous in a beautiful green colour Churidar and neatly done hair with the same colour hair clip. She is becoming more beautiful, day by day. I wanted to freeze the moment and be there for-ever. But she had a conference call and left with Haja immediately, without speaking a word. That's usual. I love her when she speaks to me and love her more when she doesn't. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"OK. Don't waste time. wash clothes, check orkut, meditate, exercise, read a book, listen to music, get ready to office,..." my mind was planning, like a bullet in motion. "whooh... whooh... hold on. Lets do, one at a time", I pressed the brake pedal. I put the clothes on the washing machine and plunged in to internet.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Suddenly I remembered Goundamani &amp;amp; Petromax light and was laughing without a reason. Googled it and amazed at the technology behind the lantern, which lit the entire world for close to a century. Posted it in Orkut. Cool. The washing was done, took the clothes and went upstairs.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"What if they left already?", a question spurred in my mind as I approached the door and ringing the bell confirmed it. Is this called ESP or thin-slicing or snap judgement or fate or time-to-relax?. A side effect of reading completely irrelevant books simutaneously. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I went to the terrace, thinking to climb down to the balcony side, using the pipe and get into the house. The fifth floor and the hot air through my lungi, suggested not to do it!... "What?. A macho man backs out? ". I convinced my super-ego that I didn't do it, because there is no rope. How clever. Hmm... I knocked next door and asked the guy, if I can use his phone to call my room mates. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"hmm... I am expecting some important calls... hmm.. actually... I don't have a phone.. my room-mates also left.. there is a phone booth in the main road. Why don't you go there and make a phone call?", he said.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"I know the phone booth. But I dont have the wallet with me. Thanks anyway", I smiled very artificially and left. How much does that cost to make a phone call?.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Sean Stephenson's facebook message in the morning, made sense now. Dude, you are awesome !&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Back in Sofia's home. Go to the first paragraph !&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PS:&lt;/b&gt; I wrote this, when I was waiting for Arun to come back from office. Just like that. Post your comments :)

Beep beep... beep beep... 4.30 AM in the morning. Feb 5, 2010. Alarm in the mobile phone Nokia 5310 is screaming. Everyone in the apartment 505 is still sleeping undisturbed, as usual. Prem snoozes the alarm without even opening his eyes. He came back from office at 1.30 AM last night (morning?). For the past three weeks, he has been working like hell and still enjoys the work !!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It's 5.00 AM in the morning. Again beep beep.. He woke up suddenly thinking about Anuraghavendran's marriage that morning at Krishnagiri. He never woke up at this time, from the day one he reached Bangalore. Of course, there are days when he was awake till this time. But never woke up from sleep. He got ready very quick and logs into orkut (his first action in any given day) and updates "Chasing sunrise in NH 7" in his status and leaves the room silently. Now-a-days, he thinks he is very poetic &amp;amp; humorous and surprisingly many of his friends do agree!. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
5.35 AM...Vrr...Vrr... kicks his room mate Arun's Bajaj Pulsar and started laughing at himself "Why the hell did I kick, when Pulsar has an electric start?". Remembering the good old days of biking in Yezdi. He drove for hours during college days, just for the sheer pleasure of driving. It is chill and dark outside. Since he is reducing weight to become slim and fit, he started shivering immediately. An extra bit of fat is always helpful in cold conditions.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lKwUvVPqi2k/UNbqpnrHYaI/AAAAAAAAVJM/iV2yB8T4MtI/s1600/driving-motorcycle-sunrise.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lKwUvVPqi2k/UNbqpnrHYaI/AAAAAAAAVJM/iV2yB8T4MtI/s320/driving-motorcycle-sunrise.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
"Venmegam pennaaga uruvaanatho !!!... Inneram enai parthu thalaiyaatutho !!!" a tamil song soothes his heart from his mp3 player. Chillness, Music &amp;amp; Driving!... No words to describe that feeling... Guys, Leave Home !...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Keeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee... A loud and long honk from a lorry brought him back to this world. "Where am I?", said to himself. The road is so clean and well lit. The minimum speed limit is 80 Km/hr. With proper lanes and green color signboards, it felt like I-75. Yeah, welcome to the present Bangalore. Its the Elevated Express way to Electronics city. He was so pleased with the driving that he forgot to take his camera out... Oops!. But he didn't regret. He said thanks to all who are involved in constructing this express way. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
It is all mist and fog, the visibility is hardly 50 mtrs. Head lights are still on and the traffic moves slowly. Most of them are trucks and containers. He always wanted to drive one of those big interstate container trucks. He said to himself "I will definitely drive one of these big fellas very soon". He didn't overtake or chase them. Drove around them in curves, like playing catch-me-if-you-can with the kids.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nqvrXDyhqr4/S23WusZRgmI/AAAAAAAAOWg/mNr5aRMGdCo/s1600-h/DSC_0003.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nqvrXDyhqr4/S23WusZRgmI/AAAAAAAAOWg/mNr5aRMGdCo/s320/DSC_0003.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Its like an animated movie. Slowly the buildings vanishes to greenery. Its all green now. NH-7. He is out of silicon valley and in TamilNadu. He read out loud, the signboards in tamil. He felt at home, even though this is the first time, he is driving alone in this road. The power of mother tongue!.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The fog spread over the grass like soft clouds. He stopped his machine to capture the beautiful scene.He took the camera bag off his shoulders and tried to click. "Oh my God! What happened to my fingers?", surprised about himself. He couldn't move his fingers at his will. Frost bitten. He saluted our heroes in Kashmir and the researchers in Antarctica. He put his hands in his Jeans pocket and started to rub his fingers. An old man who was walking on the way, stepped two feet away from him and gave him a strange look. "What am I doing in National Highways?" laughed at himself and took his hands out immediately. "Romba kuluru na", he said to the old man. The old man doesn't seem to mind it either. Click.. Click.. Click..&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nqvrXDyhqr4/S23Mezx9h0I/AAAAAAAAOVg/V_efRzQnsE8/s1600-h/DSC_0034.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nqvrXDyhqr4/S23Mezx9h0I/AAAAAAAAOVg/V_efRzQnsE8/s320/DSC_0034.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Another half an hour, drove through green lands and small towns. The Sky slowly becomes red and bright, like a blushing girl at the sight of her love. He could see the sun with his naked eye. A bright red ball, waiting for the Hercules to play. "The sun looks awesome, but I need a better view", said and driving as fast as he could, while keeping an eye on the sun. Surprisingly the entire stretch was not as good as he thought and had thick trees along the road side, he could barely see the sun. He is literally chasing the sun to take a better picture. The sky is getting brighter and brighter very fast and the tension builds up in him, to find a nice spot. Something struck his mind and he stopped right there. Took few snaps and went deep into splashing thoughts.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This happens in life, very often. "Looking for a better future, we miss to live and love today!". He stood there for a while and left to Krishnagiri to attend his friend Anuraghavendran's marriage.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nqvrXDyhqr4/S23NCF4k5oI/AAAAAAAAOVs/VFtlG0KaU4k/s1600-h/DSC_0044.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nqvrXDyhqr4/S23NCF4k5oI/AAAAAAAAOVs/VFtlG0KaU4k/s320/DSC_0044.JPG" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PS:&lt;/b&gt; This is my first travelogue in story telling style. I don't know when to end the story. So ended it here. The marriage was great and my friend Anu looks the same as he was five years ago. Smart and smiling. I wish Anu and Shalini love each other till the end of their lives.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nqvrXDyhqr4/S2Z2WekcmSI/AAAAAAAAOTA/UjtgzXnU3HU/s1600-h/2665466391_d5d5ab5239.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nqvrXDyhqr4/S2Z2WekcmSI/AAAAAAAAOTA/UjtgzXnU3HU/s320/2665466391_d5d5ab5239.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Science says that its a side effect of few chemicals like oxytocin, vasopressin, dopamine, serotonin etc. If the release of these hormones is blocked, our LOVE fades away...Oops!!!... In other words, scientists can make two people fall in love with an injection?...(Cupid becomes jobless?). They can even find the exact love-genes of the individuals and produce specific chemicals to attract that specific person... Who knows, it could even become the fastest, easiest and safest way to fall in love, in this fast paced life...Scary and sounds more like a next century sci-fi movie...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
But...&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is that all?.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Is that all to this wonderful feeling called love?.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Can anyone explain why do we fall in love with someone, rather than others?. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Which is that moment, that changes your perception of her from a normal girl to an angel from heaven?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A flash of smile, a minute spent together or a comment from a cab driver?. What triggers that emotion within you?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What makes *this* person so different and attractive from the others?.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Why is that her very presence make you feel excited and happy?. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Suddenly you feel great for being short, because she is short? (funny for most, but true to some)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even, just a thought about her pushes you to cloud nine.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even when she rejects you, you think about her all the time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Even when she doesn't want to see you around, you want her to be happy always and see her from a distance.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When there are millions of other potential girls around, you wait restlessly for a *single* chance to prove your love?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Day in, day out, your love deepens into your heart by leaps and bounds.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What makes these guys to move mountains for the one they love?&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am searching an answer for this question.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I am searching, with an intention from my heart NOT to find the answer. Strange! Isn't it?.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What happened to me?.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Love can only be experienced, and can never be written. Attempting to write them results in a scribble, like this!.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Love is a great feeling, with no past and future. Its always present in all of us. Once you experience love, you will continue to radiate love to all.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When you are in love, don't wait for the right moment.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
NOW is the right time, HERE is the right place, SHE is the right person. Go, tell her. Period.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;b&gt;PS:&lt;/b&gt; I wanted to pen down my perception about love, but ended up having more questions, with no answers. Its feels great though!.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lKwUvVPqi2k/UNbqpnrHYaI/AAAAAAAAVJM/iV2yB8T4MtI/s1600/driving-motorcycle-sunrise.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"&gt;&lt;img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-lKwUvVPqi2k/UNbqpnrHYaI/AAAAAAAAVJM/iV2yB8T4MtI/s320/driving-motorcycle-sunrise.jpg" width="320" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div style="text-align: center;"&gt;
"&lt;i&gt;When you are the fastest, you don't need rear view mirrors&lt;/i&gt;."&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Murali told me this sentence during our ECR trip to IG Resorts. He mentioned this sentence with respect to bike driving in heavy traffic in Chennai roads. This provoked a lot of thoughts in me. Even after three days, I am thinking about this sentence.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
This applies to our day to day life also. Only when you fear that some one else might be speeding than you, you look at the rear view mirror, instead of the road ahead for you !!!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Imagine, that you are in an empty race track or a infinite vast land, driving your favorite power machine... with no roads, no traffic, no other distractions.. Would you look back?. NO !!!... You would be enjoying each and every second of your drive. No fears. No set backs. Only moving forward.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That's how our life should be. Our life is not about competing with others. No one competes with you unless you think so. We have more than enough of resources, wealth, choices &amp;amp; opportunities for everyone. We should let our creativity juice to enrich this world.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
When we clearly understand that there is no competition for us, we can ONLY move forward !!!. We can choose our own road and travel as fast as we love to :)&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Let me know your thoughts !!!&lt;/div&gt;

I hate carrying mutiple credit cards in my wallet. We must get rid of this plastice cards and move on to the future. The magnetic strips in the credit cards basically identify you &amp;amp; tells the merchant if you have enough credit to purchase any product. The merchant gets the information from the credit card issuer via a phone line.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Think about this... We dont need any external items to uniquely identify us... right? Each and everyone of us has unique features like finger-prints or retina. Why cant we use them?...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Retina scan is one of the oldest &amp;amp; most secure bio-metrics available today.&amp;nbsp;The blood vessels on the back of everyone's eye has unique pattern. The retina scan uses a light source to illuminate the blood vessels which are then photographed and analysed. They use something called coupler to analyze the pattern.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Its impossible to fake a human retina at this moment. I read somewhere that the error rate of retinal scan is one in ten million where as for fingerprint, its one in 500.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Ok.. let me come to the point... I want to have a centralized database of retinal scan data of registered users.. Instead of carrying a credit card &amp;amp; swiping it... I would stare at the retinal scan for a moment.. thats it I am done... the merchant can ask for signature...&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
There must be touch screen infront of me &amp;amp; if I have multiple cards, it should get the details of all the creidt cards/debit cards from the centralized database &amp;amp; show the list of them... then I can choose any one credit / debit card.&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
At this moment retinal scan is very slow. But thats not an excuse. Thats a limitation that we need to break... I strongly believe that in future, retinal scans can be faster than the barcode scanner....&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
This is not just for financial purposes.. we can use the database to map his SSN, Driving licence, credit history, criminal backgroud etc... and anything that you could think of....&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Imagine that you violate the traffic law for some reason.. the cop need not even ask you any question... just scan your retina, he has all the information in his fingertip... &amp;nbsp;haan.. this is not good for me.. I didnt think this when I started typing this blog ;(&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Who the hell in the world needs retina scan... I prefer to carry credit cards ;)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;
Old is gold ;)&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

I strongly believe,all the atheist in this world think they are superior to everyone, which will eventually create imbalance in the society/surroundings and will create chaos and problems. If you introduce this &amp;quot;God&amp;quot; factor , it will create a fear factor in you and eventually, it will bring the peace and harmony. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Few atheist in this world proclaims that, I don&amp;#39;t believe in God, but where as I fear for my conscience. To me conscience is nothing but God withhout any idol/structure and where as religions creates an idol and gives a name to it and preaches wisdom, which will bring the peace and harmony.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/8441216392725697312/comments/default/4419344446289454444'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/8441216392725697312/comments/default/4419344446289454444'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2010/10/purpose-driven-life-what-on-earth-am-i.html?showComment=1287416605732#c4419344446289454444' title=''/><author><name>mahalingam</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/07327237099262732444</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2010/10/purpose-driven-life-what-on-earth-am-i.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-8441216392725697312' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/posts/default/8441216392725697312' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-786241377'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='October 18, 2010 at 9:13 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-1718418234628821800</id><published>2010-10-19T23:45:59.504+05:30</published><updated>2010-10-19T23:45:59.504+05:30</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Good feedback Maha.

How many Christians (well educated) still believe that Jesus will come back?. Only one thing that comes to my mind, when I think abt this. Most ppl dont believe to their heart (most of these things)...In their minds, its this.... Just in case if there happens to be a heaven and an eternal life, why should I risk?. What the heck am I going to lose by going to church and tithe?... let me follow the crowd... thats all... they feel that they are safe in both the world... thats bullshit...to me... not for them..&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;God - if, the most developed species (homo sapiens) in the world cannot handle the superiority and control over their life, let them die. In the end, some intelligent, strong leftovers will create a new community or may evolve into a new species, where everyone is powerful and everyone knows their power... like Avatar... Now 1000s of questions will come to your mind and you cannot imagine that such kind of world can exist. Because. human minds has the tendency of comparing things with the past experience (NO exceptions). Again this is a kind of speculation similar to heaven/hell concept... but derived from Darwinism.. from our observation of the history and DNA samples...&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;And I never heard of any violence, chaos or problems from atheists against religions... most revolutionaries are atheists...So, I dont see an option of what I said in the above paragraph. Also, I don&amp;#39;t want to be a sheep, guided by a shepherd... anyway....</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/8441216392725697312/comments/default/1718418234628821800'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/8441216392725697312/comments/default/1718418234628821800'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2010/10/purpose-driven-life-what-on-earth-am-i.html?showComment=1287512159504#c1718418234628821800' title=''/><author><name>Prem</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03631512354630348684</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='24' height='32' src='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nqvrXDyhqr4/Sa9ye-7Y-sI/AAAAAAAAKJU/6j3nc-kW1_0/S220/DSC07354.JPG'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2010/10/purpose-driven-life-what-on-earth-am-i.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-8441216392725697312' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/posts/default/8441216392725697312' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-280607341'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='October 19, 2010 at 11:45 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-1010173290497122808</id><published>2010-10-26T15:57:17.393+05:30</published><updated>2010-10-26T15:57:17.393+05:30</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>thankyou

None of these methods &amp;amp; end results, provide me a compelling reason to even try to know, if god exists.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Case 1 - God exists : What now?. What is the difference that the god&amp;#39;s existence is going to make in your life?. Are you going to be a better human being, helping others and find your way to heaven?. If you say yes, its a shame on you. With the superiority of the species race and a brain to think, you should already possess these qualities. &lt;br /&gt;Or, you will find inner happiness, after you have found God&amp;#39;s existence that you detach yourself from worldly experiences?. I would suggest you to die and experience it wholly.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Either case, god&amp;#39;s existence is not going to make any difference in y life.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Case 2 - God doesnt exist: Atheist will remain casual, with a grin smile. Theist would go wild, kill those who found the truth and will find another reason or superior power to cling to. Essentially these people are Sheep and need a Shepherd anyway (doesnt matter, if its a GOD or anyone who is more powerful than them) &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Think about Endhiran movie - &amp;quot;God is the one who created all. Vasigaran created me. So, GOD is present&amp;quot;. Thats a very logical answer from a machine. It first questions, the qualities of god, knows its creation and existence and declares that Vasigaran is GOD.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;How about the more powerful human minds which created the Robots?. We do not know the qualities of the GOD, we do not know our creation and existence and yet we claim that there is GOD, without any proof. Who is logical here?. We or the robots?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Whats the difference between the robots and us?. Only one. The thirst for survival. Thats the only reason, that we cling to so many bullshits, to keep our ass safe in earth and heaven.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Glad to see that you are NOT the servant of the lord :)</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/8441216392725697312/comments/default/4675357503080713979'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/8441216392725697312/comments/default/4675357503080713979'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2010/10/purpose-driven-life-what-on-earth-am-i.html?showComment=1288921567964#c4675357503080713979' title=''/><author><name>Premkumar Masilamani</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03631512354630348684</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='24' height='32' src='http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nqvrXDyhqr4/Sa9ye-7Y-sI/AAAAAAAAKJU/6j3nc-kW1_0/S220/DSC07354.JPG'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2010/10/purpose-driven-life-what-on-earth-am-i.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-8441216392725697312' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/posts/default/8441216392725697312' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-280607341'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='November 5, 2010 at 7:16 AM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-4666326556365052708</id><published>2010-12-01T15:04:02.465+05:30</published><updated>2010-12-01T15:04:02.465+05:30</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>thodarnthu ezhuthungal

Now, the calculation becomes&lt;br /&gt;Worth of Gold = 10 * 8 * 2300 = Rs. 1,84,000&lt;br /&gt;Making charge of 13% = Rs. 23,920.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Who benefits from the difference amount Rs.3,120?. The Gold Smith who toiled to make the jewellery?. A hell NO. Its the Jewellers. Why should I pay them?.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the Gold Price drops, they simply increase the making charges to 18% or 20% and may act like reducing for us. In any case, they do not lose money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Ideally, the making charge should be a fixed rate, irrespective of the Gold Price. As long as, it is a %, I suggest everyone to bargain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If I buy 100 soverigns of gold, Do you think I will pay 2.5 lacs for making charges?. I would rather throw the money out in T.Nagar streets.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;b) I agree with this. &lt;br /&gt;c) I agree. The amount of gold remains the same. Just the charges you pay increases. Assuming you do not pay for melting charges, you may calculate like this. &lt;br /&gt;1 sovereign @ 1500 = 12,000&lt;br /&gt;making charge 10% = 1,200&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Exchanging for the new jewels with the same % of making charge.&lt;br /&gt;1 sovereign @ 2000 = 16,000&lt;br /&gt;making charge 10% = 1,600&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Difference amount = Rs. 400 which you have lost while exchanging. One suggestion, if you remember the making charges you have paid, do the math and bargain for a %, such that you do not lose money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks friend for additional information.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/5890565261116206389'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/5890565261116206389'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html?showComment=1334726685074#c5890565261116206389' title=''/><link rel='related' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/3835527267795269764'/><author><name>Premkumar Masilamani</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03631512354630348684</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UBMnwe7ssFA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/T5twKq0CoYM/s512-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-2988331630963748178' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/posts/default/2988331630963748178' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-280607341'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='April 18, 2012 at 10:54 AM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-2856514946577883726</id><published>2012-04-25T17:19:17.926+05:30</published><updated>2012-04-25T17:19:17.926+05:30</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>ack and Bill are men on a mission.

I went to a jewellery in Trivandrum. Incidentally, I have been purchasing for years from its other branches in Kerala. Just this April, I went to the same jewellery at the same place and bought a bangle and an anklet, paying 9% making charge. I always calculate the making charge before I buy anything and do not take what the salesman tells me at face value. Now, this salesman said the MC is 7% and I calculated and found out that it was 9%. I told him that straight to his face, and he tried to argue with me, and finally that joker told me the MC was 7% and the 2% was deducted from the price of the jewellery (BIS 916 hallmarked)I exchanged. I lost my cool at his bluffing and asked to see his manager. I told the manager that his salesman had the nerve to tell me that they were reducing the exchange rate of the gold I exchanged. The manager was a sensible guy and immediately apologized. I told him that despite my finding that the making charge was 9%, the salesman told me it was 7%. I told them not to confuse customers and to be straightforward. The manager agreed with me and asked me if I wanted to talk to the top guy there. I said &amp;quot;no&amp;quot; as it was already late and I wanted to get back home.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yesterday, I went to this jewellery again. I had a pair of very small earrings, one of which I lost. I wanted a replacement. Since the exact size was not available, I took a pair of similar but smaller earrings. Weight was 0.888 grams. After reducing the weight of the stones, the weight was 0.788 grams. Yesterday&amp;#39;s gold rate was 2,800/gram. When they gave me the estimate, I was shocked to see a bill of Rs. 3,250. And guess what, the MC was 26%!!!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;By my calculation,&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Gold price: 0.788 X 2,800= 2206.4&lt;br /&gt;MC@26%:573.664&lt;br /&gt;VAT:27.8&lt;br /&gt;Total: Rs. 2807.864&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, how did they give me the bill of Rs. 3,250? The stones are worthless. The price of one stone would not have come to more than Rs. 50. So, add Rs. 300 to it, and you get Rs. 3,108.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But I told them that the MC should not be more than 10%. I will not pay anything more than Rs. 2,400. And I said, I wanted the price of the stone and the price of the gold marked in the bill. The salesman refused! I walked out!&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/533177202031135003'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/533177202031135003'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html?showComment=1345093176097#c533177202031135003' title=''/><author><name>Sithara Anand</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-2988331630963748178' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/posts/default/2988331630963748178' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-2091416297'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='August 16, 2012 at 10:29 AM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-4399532512244763243</id><published>2012-08-16T12:16:09.135+05:30</published><updated>2012-08-16T12:16:09.135+05:30</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Hi Sivanoli - Thanks for sharing more information ...</title><content type='html'>Hi Sivanoli - Thanks for sharing more information with the readers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It is wise to invest in gold coins (if you have excess money) and put it in any gold deposit scheme of any trusted bank (like SBI). Your gold grows in value at the same time earns you interest.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But, when it comes to selling, you most probably have to lose a portion of the gold price to ANYONE who buys gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I would say selling gold is losing your money. Don&amp;#39;t sell. If you want money urgently try gold loans against your gold and settle the loan as soon as possible.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Once you have Xg of gold, you should strive to acquire (X+Y)g of gold. That&amp;#39;s growth. If your wealth goes to (X-Y)g of gold, there is something serious that you need to look after your finances.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Just my views. Not hard facts. Your opinion may differ. I would love to know.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/4399532512244763243'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/4399532512244763243'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html?showComment=1345099569135#c4399532512244763243' title=''/><link rel='related' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/6042068524129433295'/><author><name>Premkumar Masilamani</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03631512354630348684</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UBMnwe7ssFA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/T5twKq0CoYM/s512-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-2988331630963748178' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/posts/default/2988331630963748178' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-280607341'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='August 16, 2012 at 12:16 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-9041450095139709041</id><published>2012-08-16T12:20:33.715+05:30</published><updated>2012-08-16T12:20:33.715+05:30</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>That&amp;#39;s another thing.

Check out the LHR results and you could see particles travelling faster than light. What will happen to relativity theory?.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;When the quantom theory was proposed, everyone ridiculed it. But now, its an accepted theory.

I have always had this uneasy feeling while buying gold that I am being cheated, be it local market jewelers or big brands such as Tanishq. One of my friends invested in their gold scheme but by the time it matured the gold prices had steeped so high that we had to take out money from our savings! Not to mention that they charged 30% making charges on a pendant. &lt;br /&gt;The information here will really help us in negotiating with jewelers in future, for I know understand the different amounts they charge.   &lt;br /&gt;I also wanted some info about hallmark charges. What do they charge in South India? In late 2010, we bought a gold chain from a Gurgaon jeweler and they charged us 500 bucks but I read on some website that it&amp;#39;s negligible for gold jewelery. Would appreciate any info? &lt;br /&gt;Thanks and Regards</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/9153982343500414045'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/9153982343500414045'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html?showComment=1345212526457#c9153982343500414045' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-2988331630963748178' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/posts/default/2988331630963748178' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-2011880520'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='August 17, 2012 at 7:38 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-6650760412337953390</id><published>2012-08-18T11:44:21.035+05:30</published><updated>2012-08-18T11:44:21.035+05:30</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Hi Friend - There are 185 Assaying and Hallmarking...</title><content type='html'>Hi Friend - There are 185 Assaying and Hallmarking centers in India. As of August 1st, 2012 the hallmarking charges for individual gold ornament is Rs. 25 (does not matter, if its 1 gram or 10 kilograms). In 2010, it was Rs. 18.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;However you don&amp;#39;t need to pay that money. It should be already covered in any of the charges levied by the jewellers.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Don&amp;#39;t be surprised, if jewellers come up with hallmarking charges as standard charge and tie it to the weight of the ornament. They may charge Rs. 100 for 1 gram and Rs. 1000 for 10 grams (just an example)&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Most of us, innocent poeple would not know the truth and will pay that amount.

But i would like to throw to u a few truth. Pls get the facts straight..&lt;br /&gt;Cadmimum is not something that is mixed in making gold jewelery, but in actual it is used to solder gold jewels beacuse of its good properties of easy liquidity and low melting temperature.&lt;br /&gt; &lt;br /&gt;A gold jewellery of 22K(916) contains 91.6% gold and the remaining 8.4% is either copper of silver and a very few traces of cadmium. Because of the soft nature of gold other alloy is mixed(pref: copper or silver) to make it worth making a jewellery.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As far a business model is concerned jewellery has now become too transparent that any body can predict how much profit the jeweller just made. Tell me one product where u can say the manufacturer or seller is making this much, that much.( U would be probaly never know that a drug thats manufacturing cost is just 35 is sold in a pharmacy for 750)&lt;br /&gt;  &lt;br /&gt;This is a sample calculation i want to show.&lt;br /&gt;As on 5th oct Pure Gold(24k) of 99.9 24k=31500/10grms. 22k=29300/10g&lt;br /&gt;Go to any bank offering gold coins of 99.9 and for sure ur price would be 33000&lt;br /&gt;that is 31500+5%=33075.or may be 31500+3%=32445&lt;br /&gt;Dont ask why 5%! the jewellers may be cheats but not banks, so ask urself&lt;br /&gt;Now I m purchasing 10 grams of chain of ring or whatever jewel it may be..&lt;br /&gt;10g 91.6 = 10g(91.6) + 10% wastage( u will agree it is reasonable)&lt;br /&gt;in money terms = 10g * 2930( that&amp;#39;s todays gold rate) + 10% wastage&lt;br /&gt; which is      = 29300+2930&lt;br /&gt;and that makes =32230. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As it is business and not charity the jeweller must have incurred some cost to make the jewel. U probably do not want it done free of cost right. say 3 to 4%( dont calculate in money terms. that is not the realty in this business).That makes the jeweller earn 6% To 10%( max) on his investment. That is not bad i guess. Who doesn&amp;#39;t make 5 to 10 percent business. U invest 1Lak and would not u expect 5000 out of it. IF this is cheating probably u and i are cheated every second out of each and every product.&lt;br /&gt;You never know another fact that is not just gold but probably every metal from iron copper zinc to brass nickel and steel there is a lot of %business done. &lt;br /&gt;Another irony is that some persons Capable of buying 100 soverings i.e worth 24lakhs is frowning over this. Who is poor here man. Who cannot afford here. &lt;br /&gt;You guys are probably wasting a lot on lot of things u never know and never wanna to calculate and here people are ready to throw off lakhs on road rather just because u feel that the cost of buying a property(gold) is high and visible.  &lt;br /&gt;U may be driving the economy mileage giving bike but did u ever know that you bought a 35000(manufacturing cost) worth bike for 48000 or gave away 20 bucks for a cold drink that probably cost 2 for the manufacturer. The list goes on&lt;br /&gt;No business can thrive on the model of cheating. But yes there a few out there waiting for unsuspecting customers. But think rational and think wise before making decisions. U lose something to gain something. In business somebody&amp;#39;s loss is anothers profit but it is not Cheating.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;To know more about Gold visit this place &lt;br /&gt;http://www.goldpalace.com/gold_jewelry.htm &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BUt Kudos to you Prem u created ablog for this. It sure is a good step on Your behalf. All my comments are not directly to you but also to some of those who posted their comments. Invest in gold periodically is my advice to all. Use ocassions in ur life as an  excuse to buy gold and silver, birthdays anniversarys and like wise.

Thanks for pointing out. Regarding the other question about bargaining - here is my view point.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. No one does business for charity - I agree and I mentioned in the blog itself. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. When there is a chance to reduce the money you pay, why not reduce it? - That&amp;#39;s the whole point behind this blog.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if you bargain for 2 hours, no jeweller is going to sell gold for loss. Agree? So, if they are willing to reduce their profit a little, why not capitalize it?. Its your money anyway, is n&amp;#39;t it?. Am I wrong here?.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Trust me friend, I have not seen a single jeweller who is not willing to reduce the initial price they said for a gold ornament. There is no fixed MRP. We all know the gold market. Don&amp;#39;t we?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I am not sure about other people who are throwing their money out on roads. This blog is primarily for the people who has very little saving or who must buy gold for some special occasion. I am trying save few hundreds or thousands. That&amp;#39;s all.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I hope, I made my intention clear.

The carat meter at the showroom showed my bangles purity at 83% and I was told that in order to bring the purity to 95% (according to them, 91.6 to 95% purity is considered for 22 ct and anything above 95% falls in the 23 ct onwards range), i would have to compensate by 12% (95%-83%). I paid about 5% making charge above this. No wastage or melting charge etc was charged. I am satisfied with the valuation process but have one concern. The gold bangle that i bought is BIS hallmarked for 91.6%, whereas the deficit that i paid, used 95% as the purity base. However, the caratmeter showed the new bangle purity at 95%. Which one should i consider accurate, the BIS hallmark purity stamp 91.6% or the caratmeter?&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/3411702205884909698'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/3411702205884909698'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html?showComment=1349638368612#c3411702205884909698' title=''/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-2988331630963748178' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/posts/default/2988331630963748178' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1681914144'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='October 8, 2012 at 1:02 AM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-6144462684219337364</id><published>2012-10-08T22:14:42.594+05:30</published><updated>2012-10-08T22:14:42.594+05:30</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>thanks buddy nice information sharing on fb.

The loss is just the making charges... Mr. Premkumar, though you have posted this blog with good intentions, please think about the artisans who toil while making the jewellery... Can you name an industry which manufactures for a value addition of less than 10%? I Doubt... Even brokers in all other businesses charge 2%... Please see all the aspects before passing judgements.........</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/7595418356677724953'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/7595418356677724953'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html?showComment=1351769169469#c7595418356677724953' title=''/><link rel='related' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/4541703730676662351'/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-2988331630963748178' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/posts/default/2988331630963748178' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1063984690'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='November 1, 2012 at 4:56 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-6728499887263204720</id><published>2012-11-01T17:08:48.371+05:30</published><updated>2012-11-01T17:08:48.371+05:30</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Premkumar, rather than going after jewellery showr...</title><content type='html'>Premkumar, rather than going after jewellery showrooms, focus on Banks, which charge a markup of 13 - 15% on Gold Coins by saying that the Gold is imported and 99.99% pure.... as if the rest of the gold is produced in India and of inferior quality.... &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/6728499887263204720'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/6728499887263204720'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html?showComment=1351769928371#c6728499887263204720' title=''/><link rel='related' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/3835527267795269764'/><author><name>Anonymous</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-2988331630963748178' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/posts/default/2988331630963748178' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1063984690'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='November 1, 2012 at 5:08 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-8458372016982614006</id><published>2012-11-03T17:04:54.817+05:30</published><updated>2012-11-03T17:04:54.817+05:30</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Now i am cleard in MC and purity of gold ..

Other day before coming across your blog, I accompanied my wife to Tanishq show room at Coimbatore for buying some jewels. She purchased two small pieces of jewellery and the pricing of each proceeded as shown below.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item 1: Bangle(of type wrist kadagam or Kadaa)&lt;br /&gt;Weight of the jewel                           =   12.48 gm&lt;br /&gt;Caratage                                      =   18 k&lt;br /&gt;Price of  24k gold that day                   = Rs 3245/- per gm&lt;br /&gt;Price of  18k gold as derived from above      = Rs 3245*18/24&lt;br /&gt;                                               = Rs 2434 per gm&lt;br /&gt;Value of the gold in the jewel                 = Rs 2434*12.48&lt;br /&gt;                                               = Rs 30373.20&lt;br /&gt;Wastage( @23%)                                 = Rs 30373.20* 23/100&lt;br /&gt;                                               = Rs 6985.84&lt;br /&gt;Making Charges                                 =  Nil&lt;br /&gt;Total Cost   = Rs 30373.20 + Rs 6985.84        = Rs 37359.04&lt;br /&gt;VAT    @ 2%                                    = Rs   747.18&lt;br /&gt;Final payable price                            = Rs 38106.22&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Item 2 : Ear Studs.&lt;br /&gt;Weight of the jewel                            = 8.8 gm &lt;br /&gt;Caratage                                       = 22 k&lt;br /&gt;Price of 24 k Gold per gm                      = Rs 3245&lt;br /&gt;Price of 22 k Gold per gm                      = Rs 3245 * 22/24&lt;br /&gt;                                               = Rs 2975&lt;br /&gt;Price of the Gold in the jewel                 = Rs 2975 * 8.8&lt;br /&gt;                                               = Rs 26180&lt;br /&gt;Wastage       @ 9%                             = Rs  2356.20&lt;br /&gt;Total Price                                    = Rs 28536.20&lt;br /&gt;VAT @2%                                        = Rs   570.72&lt;br /&gt;Net payable Price                              = Rs 29106.92   &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In this one point I noted is that any wastage should be expressed as a percentage of the total gold deployed for the fabrication of the jewel and not on the gold contained in the piece that is being sold.&lt;br /&gt;We may be compelled to believe that appropriate mathematical adjustment has been effected by the manufacturer.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;While the vendor is charging the customer for wastage, he has neither added the making charges or the cost towards the quantum alloy ie 3.12 gm in respect of the bangle and approx .8 gm in respect of the studs.   If the wastage is equivalent of &amp;quot;scrap&amp;quot; as applicable to any other metal industry(like say manufacturing an automobile component from out of a metal rod), then it should be debitable/ chargeable  to the vendor and not to the purchaser. Hence as somebody had suggested in this column either the raw gold should be given to the purchaser or more appropriately the the wastage should be &amp;quot;SUBTRACTED&amp;quot;( YES &amp;quot;SUBTRACTED&amp;quot;) and not added to the price chargeable to the customer.&lt;br /&gt;As per the present practice, the customer appears to be suffering doubly(in kind as well as in cash) and the vendor appears to be gaining on two fronts( in cash and in kind).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;KINDLY ENLIGHTEN ME ON THIS ASPECT AS IT IS QUITE A SERIOUS ONE.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Above all, I want to know as to whether the gold industry has not advanced technologically at all because of which the manufacturers inevitably are leaving such a huge amount of valuable gold to go waste. Or the technology is available but the benefit is not passed on to the customer and reaped by the manufacturers and vendors themselves. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Lastly, Is the government not acting with alacrity on this issue because it considers as if a major portion of the money that circulates is black and generally pertains to super-rich people who do not/would not bother about such issues.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Wish you will share and get more views.                </content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/5733642275230447874'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/5733642275230447874'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html?showComment=1353850096416#c5733642275230447874' title=''/><author><name>Villavankothai V R (virrkoe)</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-2988331630963748178' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/posts/default/2988331630963748178' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1110871337'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='November 25, 2012 at 6:58 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-2929316941028363312</id><published>2012-11-26T03:08:49.863+05:30</published><updated>2012-11-26T03:08:49.863+05:30</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Thanks Villavankothai for the detailed comment. So...</title><content type='html'>Thanks Villavankothai for the detailed comment. Some basics here.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;1. Gold is mined from gold ore (looks like rocks). Gold can be economically mined from 0.5 ppm (parts per million). In other words, extracting 0.5 gm of gold from 1000 kg of gold ore.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;2. History says that gold mining is at least 7000 yrs old (yes. 5000 BC).&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So, the mining process is very old and the technology is very advanced that we don&amp;#39;t waste a single milligram of gold.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If you go to a gold smith, give him 100 gms of gold bar, ask him to make an ornament. He gives you an ornament worth 77 gms. Will you be happy to pay him the making charges and come home with the 77 gms ornament?. At least, you would ask him to return the 23 gms of gold right?. If not 23, at least 20. Won&amp;#39;t you?. That&amp;#39;s what happened in your case. You could have bargained.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Technically nothings is wasted now-a-days. Gold smith can recover every milligram of gold.You are paying for the calculated wasted gold. That&amp;#39;s just free money to the owner.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;I don&amp;#39;t understand the concept of subtracting the money from the ornament. Enlighten me. Ideal thing would be to pay for the gold, pay for the alloy, pay the making charges (not a %). That&amp;#39;s it.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding the other question - Government&amp;#39;s involvement:  This making/wastage charges are a problem only for the middle class people who buy gold in little quantities. Rich people buying gold in large quantities strike a business deal with the jewellery shop, rather bargaining. So, they do not bother about any of these.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Do you really think, that govt (basically politicians) will get involved, implement strict rules and in turn reduce their income (black money)?. I doubt that.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Any free market is driven by the demand. Things will come to it&amp;#39;s right place, when the demand is less. Indians and gold are inseparable. So, while waiting for the perfect market, lets try to bargain and reduce the money that we &amp;quot;waste&amp;quot; on wastage charges?&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/2929316941028363312'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/2929316941028363312'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html?showComment=1353879529863#c2929316941028363312' title=''/><link rel='related' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/5733642275230447874'/><author><name>Premkumar Masilamani</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03631512354630348684</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UBMnwe7ssFA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/T5twKq0CoYM/s512-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-2988331630963748178' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/posts/default/2988331630963748178' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-280607341'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='November 26, 2012 at 3:08 AM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-7529665675839611365</id><published>2012-11-26T13:18:47.461+05:30</published><updated>2012-11-26T13:34:24.909+05:30</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Dear Maasilaamanhi!

Thanks for your immediate res...</title><content type='html'>Dear Maasilaamanhi!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Thanks for your immediate response. &amp;quot;Subtracting the money from the ornament value&amp;quot; will be applicable if wastage as a concept is acceptable. Let me explain.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Consider an SSI owner who undertakes contract jobs for an auto mobile major for supplying crank-shafts. Let us also assume that each  crank-shaft is to be produced by taking a rod of appropriate length and diameter which may be milled/knurled/planed using appropriate machinery and tools till such time the whole piece is realised with specified dimensions. When the rod undergoes various manufacturing processes the unwanted portion of the metal/alloy rod is scraped off and becomes like steel wool which has to disposed off as scrap. Now, various factors like cost of raw material, cost of operations, Labor cost profit margin etc are worked out for arriving at the fee per piece manufactured. But, at this point the quantum of scrap which is generated at the premises of the contractor during the various manufacturing processes and which will be disposed off by the contractor is also assessed/calculated and the amount which is likely to be obtained by selling that as scrap is subtracted from the fees arrived at earlier.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;If we apply similar principles for manufacture of gold jewelry as well the waste, which is assumed to be generated SHOULD NOT BE ADDED to the customer&amp;#39;s liability, but SHOULD BE SUBTRACTED from the customer&amp;#39;s liability b&amp;#39;cos the gold-scrap is retained by the vendor. I hope to have made the issue clear. With regards  virrkoe.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/7529665675839611365'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/7529665675839611365'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html?showComment=1353916127461#c7529665675839611365' title=''/><link rel='related' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/5733642275230447874'/><author><name>V R Villavankothai (virrkoe)</name><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img1.blogblog.com/img/blank.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-2988331630963748178' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/posts/default/2988331630963748178' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-1858866453'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='November 26, 2012 at 1:18 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-5505492741954262033</id><published>2012-11-26T13:43:15.542+05:30</published><updated>2012-11-26T13:43:15.542+05:30</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Thanks Villavankothai for the explanation.

It is applicable, only if you supply the raw material and get the final product. It does not apply, if you just buy the final product from stores.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In gold purchase, you do not provide the raw material. You simply purchase the final product. Just take my earlier example. If you give him 100 gms, you get an ornament of 77 gms, you can ask him to subtract the 23 gms worth of money.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;In our case, we DO NOT supply the 100 gms. All we do is pay for the 77 gms (+23 gms of wastage gold). This wastage charge is, what we do not want to pay.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Why would anyone subtract the money for 23 gms. In effect, what you ask is, pay for 54 gms (100 -23 -23) and get 77 gms?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Did I understand this right?.

Just get out and look for another jewellery shop.</content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/7071930213280916966'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/7071930213280916966'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html?showComment=1355318634833#c7071930213280916966' title=''/><link rel='related' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/6792436214656354602'/><author><name>Premkumar Masilamani</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/03631512354630348684</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh3.googleusercontent.com/-UBMnwe7ssFA/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAAAA/T5twKq0CoYM/s512-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-2988331630963748178' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/posts/default/2988331630963748178' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-280607341'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='December 12, 2012 at 6:53 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-3232237094616075863</id><published>2013-01-12T17:16:18.159+05:30</published><updated>2013-01-12T17:16:18.159+05:30</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>sir thank you this usefull and remember article an...</title><content type='html'>sir thank you this usefull and remember article and thank&amp;#39;s to commentators &lt;br /&gt;  </content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/3232237094616075863'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/3232237094616075863'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html?showComment=1357991178159#c3232237094616075863' title=''/><author><name>ghanshyam dodiya</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/14295074236517600396</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='32' height='32' src='//lh5.googleusercontent.com/-QjRk855W7Xg/AAAAAAAAAAI/AAAAAAAAABA/zkiFw73AS7k/s512-c/photo.jpg'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-2988331630963748178' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/posts/default/2988331630963748178' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-87742205'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='January 12, 2013 at 5:16 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-1758991373272285458</id><published>2013-02-09T11:08:00.821+05:30</published><updated>2013-02-09T11:08:00.821+05:30</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>I want to file a complaint against some members of...</title><content type='html'>I want to file a complaint against some members of HDFC : &lt;br /&gt;Mr. Hari OM (Manager), &lt;br /&gt;Mr. Deepak, &lt;br /&gt;Ms Priyanka. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;These people are very arrogant and not helpful at all.

He verified my signature with my signature he has on file and told me that - it does not match. there was a slight variation.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;He gave me a paper and make me sign and started verifying each and every signature. after 10 attempts, i could not get it right. everytime there was a slight variation.

The salesman told us that there are NO making charges (MA) on Diamonds and around 10% MA on the 18C gold (Rate/ Gm : 2508)&lt;br /&gt;So&lt;br /&gt;Diamond Pendant Gold: 1.092gm X 2058= 2247&lt;br /&gt;Diamond: 0.19C X 75000= 14250&lt;br /&gt;VA: 1575&lt;br /&gt;Diamond Ear ring Gold: 1.764gm X 2058= 3630&lt;br /&gt;Diamond: 0.13C X 75000= 9750&lt;br /&gt;VA: 1940&lt;br /&gt; Total Diamond Cost= 24000&lt;br /&gt; Total Gold Cost= 5877&lt;br /&gt; Total VA= 3515 &lt;br /&gt; Total= 33392&lt;br /&gt;The SA claimed the VA was 10.5% conveniently ignoring the fact that the Diamond did not carry any making charges. After much haggling ( with him and later the manager) they gave us a Rs 1589 discount pointing out the MA was now 6%. We were pleased with ourselves and walked out with the purchase. At home it dawned on us that we were conned big time. On closer inspection we realized the original MA was a whopping 59.8% on the value of gold.&lt;br /&gt;VA (Rs 3515)/ Gold Value (Rs 5877)X 100 = 59.8%&lt;br /&gt; The Rs 1589 discount brought down the MA from 3515 to 1926. Still a massive 32.7% on the Value of gold.&lt;br /&gt;VA (Rs 1926)/ Gold Value (Rs 5877)X 100 = 32.7%&lt;br /&gt;I always knew jewelers made handsome profits by conning customers, but this was broad daylight robbery. I just may have purchased my last piece of jewelry. Or so till there is some uniformity and transparency in making charges. </content><link rel='edit' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/3068759022464896877'/><link rel='self' type='application/atom+xml' href='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/2988331630963748178/comments/default/3068759022464896877'/><link rel='alternate' type='text/html' href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html?showComment=1374563441219#c3068759022464896877' title=''/><author><name>sajit augustine</name><uri>http://www.blogger.com/profile/05854806094336139140</uri><email>noreply@blogger.com</email><gd:image rel='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#thumbnail' width='16' height='16' src='http://img2.blogblog.com/img/b16-rounded.gif'/></author><thr:in-reply-to href='http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/04/buying-gold-jewellery-know-facts-first.html' ref='tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-2988331630963748178' source='http://www.blogger.com/feeds/2064933559358236392/posts/default/2988331630963748178' type='text/html'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.itemClass' value='pid-124628071'/><gd:extendedProperty name='blogger.displayTime' value='July 23, 2013 at 12:40 PM'/></entry><entry><id>tag:blogger.com,1999:blog-2064933559358236392.post-8878672855715639913</id><published>2013-09-04T15:29:46.654+05:30</published><updated>2013-09-04T20:35:24.541+05:30</updated><category scheme='http://schemas.google.com/g/2005#kind' term='http://schemas.google.com/blogger/2008/kind#comment'/><title type='text'>Hey, I d like to try your challenge too.
