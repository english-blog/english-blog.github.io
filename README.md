## Smile Prem Website

Hi - This is my personal website, built with jekyll, hosted on GitHub pages with a little customization of the default template.

All the artifacts in this repository is opensource. You can fork this repo and use it as you wish.

I would be extremely happy, if you link back to the site when, you cite or use the blog content in your blogs (not mandatory though)

Remember this quote always:

> If you have an apple & I have an apple & if we exchange apples - we both will have one apple each  
  If you have an idea & I have an idea & if we exchange ideas - we both will have two ideas each  

Let open source be the de-facto for every industry in this world.

Thanks,  
Prem
