## disrupting the known &amp; the unknown

This website is built with Jekyll, hosted on GitHub pages with HTML only. (Not even CSS)  
  
All the artifacts in this repository are opensource. You can fork this repo and use it as you wish.  

I would be extremely happy, if you link back to the site when, you use the content in your website/blogs (not mandatory though)  

Remember this quote always:  

> If you have an apple & I have an apple & if we exchange apples - we both will have one apple each  
  If you have an idea & I have an idea & if we exchange ideas - we both will have two ideas each  

Let open source be the de-facto for every industry in this world.  

Thanks,  
Another Homo Sapien.
