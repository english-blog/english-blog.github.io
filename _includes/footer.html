I love to run, lift weights, eat healthy, think, write, read, question, learn, travel, meet new people, repeatedly challenge myself on various aspects of living, become a guinea pig for my own experiments and indulge in monologues/debates when I have nothing else to do.<br/>
<br/>
This blog summarizes everything that I am. This blog details some of my experiences, experiments and thought processes which may help you to live a better life. So, Go ahead. Dive In.<br/><br/>
