If a picture is worth thousand words, how about a video then?. Here is an introductory video to EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique). It is essential that you know about EFT, before reading the review about this book. I found this is the best video that was ever made for EFT. Watch it completely before you scroll down for the book review.

The Traditional Chinese Medicine claims that there is a path through which the life-energy was known as "qi" flows. They are called Meridians or Energy Meridians. Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) proposed by Gary Craig in 1993 states that "The cause of all negative emotions is a disruption in the body's energy system". Those energy blockages can be released by simply tapping on the energy meridians while recalling the memory which brings about the negative emotions. EFT claims that it cured a wide variety of emotional issues and physical pain/diseases etc. The beauty of EFT is that, once you have identified the correct memory and the aspect and tapped it properly, it fixes the problem immediately and the results are usually permanent. The Basic Recipe process takes hardly two minutes to perform and anyone can easily learn to perform it without difficulty.  
  
On the other side, Critics say that there is no known anatomical basis for the existence of acupuncture points or meridians and even if EFT works, there is no tangible proof that "tapping of energy meridians" actually brought the results.Several controlled studies show that EFT actually works, but concluded that any benefit is due to traditional cognitive components, such as the placebo effect, the distraction from negative thoughts, and the therapeutic benefit of having someone actually listen, rather than from manipulation of meridians.  
  
Yes. Science won't accept it, till it has verifiable proof. But, Should we wait till then?. Let the scientists work hard to find the reason and let's start using EFT meanwhile. It takes hardly two minutes and no side effects. If it works, be happy. Otherwise, forget it. What's a big deal?. I have used it on myself for few haunting emotions and I am better now. Great!. EFT claims that it can cure physical ailments as well. I am perfectly healthy and in perfect shape. I can try this on my eyesight. Yes, I have myopia of 3.5 diopters as of Sep 10, 2011. I will post an update to this blog if I improve my eyesight using EFT :)  
  
Let's start the review of the book now. The founder of EFT Gary Craig wrote this book, explaining everything in detail. The book is divided into two parts. The first part explains the origin of EFT and details the lists of scientific studies, controlled trials and comparative studies done on EFT. I suggest you read this chapter completely so that your mind will be prepared and receptive to the future chapters. This is quite elaborate. I would love to shrink this chapter in future editions.  
  
The next chapter is the "How-to" of EFT. It takes you through the step-by-step process to learn EFT. By the end of this chapter, you would be proficient in applying the Basic Recipe to some of your emotional/physical problems. Yeah. It's that easy !. This portion covers the Psychological Reversal, Aspects, Generalization Effect, Peace Procedure, Movie & Story Technique etc. These chapters are precise and to the point. I love this chapter.  
  
The second part explains the advanced concepts in EFT, which you may not need in most of the cases. But, be sure that you know these. Collarbone Breathing Exercise, Shortcuts, Energy Toxins, 9 Gamut Procedure etc. There is an elaborate chapter on Frequently Asked Questions, which answers most of your questions about EFT. Lots of real-world case studies are also included for your reference. (Just the names & incidents... No references). More advanced concepts like Surrogate Tapping, Borrowing Benefits etc can be learned in the workshops.  
  
Gary Craig gave out all the information that he "invented" for free to the world. But, there are a lot of people who just modify the content, rename it and make a lot of money out it. Still, you get a lot of free information over the internet, a free newsletter to your emails etc. Here are some of the links.
