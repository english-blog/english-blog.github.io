Back to Robin Sharma again. Every now and then, if you don't read Robin's book, you are definitely missing something from your life. He is the guiding star for me. Providing me the wisdom I need and miraculously at the right time. You call it coincidence or whatever. Thanks, Robin.  

The Greatness Guide - 101 short essays and stories to inspire you and help you achieve your greatness in all walks of your life. This book is slightly different from his other books. This is a collection of essays and event that happened in Robin's life, written in different periods and at different places, put together in one book for us. I don't know what to mention in the review and what to leave. If I had to write a perfect review of this book, I have to reprint the book's content here. He reiterates the importance of leading without a title in this book as well.    

Here are few of my favorites from his book.   

* Reading a book by someone you respect allows some of their brilliance to rub off on you. - He stresses the importance of reading habit. Its one of the best discipline. I knew the benefit of this habit by experience. Guys - Please read.  

* Leadership begins with the extra mile.  

* Focus + Daily Improvement + Time = Genius  

* Every time you say YES to something unimportant, you say NO to something that is important.  

* Challenge serves beautifully to introduce you to your best and the brilliant self.  

* If you think something cannot occur in your life, there is no way you will take the action required to make that goal a reality. Your "impossibility thinking" manifests itself.  

* Being a leader isn't about being liked. It's about doing what's right.  

* You are here to find that cause, that vital destiny that will move you at the most visceral level and get you up at the crack of dawn with fire in your belly.  

* Your schedule is the best barometer for what you truly value and believe to be important. - Your schedule doesn't lie.  

* Try not to teach your fears to your kids. Introduce them to what's possible.  

* This world was built by people who felt some discontent with the way things were and knew they could do better.  

* Top athletes know that PRACTICE gets you to greatness.  

* Be outrageously energetic and madly alive - I like the concept of being wildly enthusiastic.  

* The two Magic words - Thank You. Loved this chapter on appreciating others help.  

* The words you use influence the life you live. Select them wisely.  

* I want the experience of an old man, while I'm still young. Collapse the timeline - nice ideas in this chapter.  

* Join the 5 O'clock Club. Get up early. - I guess I am winning the battle to my bed. :)  

* Good health is like a crown on the head of a good person that only a sick person can see. - 100% true. Exercise regularly.  

* Greatness arrives for those who are never satisfied with what is, no matter how nice it looks.  

* Everyone is a leader. But not everyone is the same. - Yes. Know your role and perform it to the perfection.  

* Give out what you most want to come back. - The concepts were different. Read it  

* Commit to first class. Never settle for anything less.  

* Delete what needs to be eliminated from your life. You will feel lighter, happier and your mind will experience more peace.  

* What happened to "Please"?. Good manners are a stepping stone to being a remarkable human being.  

* Life tests the big dreamers - the passionate revolutionaries - Don't give up.  

* Do a "101 things to do before I die" list. - I started preparing mine. What about you?.  

I actually wanted to list down my favorite chapter but ended up writing almost all. I took a lot of time to delete many of them from the list, just to give you a glimpse of the book. Trust me, this book is packed with much more wisdom that I listed here. Start the winning habit. Start reading. Grab this book.
