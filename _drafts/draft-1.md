What comes to your mind when you think about the future of the automobile industry?

- Connected Vehicles
- Software Defined Vehicles
- Alternate Fuel Vehicles (Electric, Solar, Hydrogen etc)
- Shared Mobility
- Autonomous Vehicles
- and so on.

These are extraordinary ideas and numerous startups are working hard at them to elevate customer's driving experience. Most of the ideas out there are focussed on making the car more efficient (fuel, cost, driving comfort, etc.) when a human being is interacting with the car. We are limited by the thought process of "what a car can do?".

All the cars that are being produced today, has a lot of mini/mega computers in it. Let's flip the idea of a car.

Instead of thinking,

> My car has a network of computers in it.

think,

> A network of computers on four wheels drives me around. 

Instead of asking, "what a car can do?", ask, "what a computer can do?". The answer is everything (almost).

Let's imagine a moment in the future. You want to take your girlfriend to dinner.

- While sitting in your couch, you open your car app in your mobile phone and say, "Hey, Eva (of course, your car has a name), I want to take my girlfriend to her favorite restaurant, tonight". Your car app replies, "Sure, let me take care of. Have fun tonight!"
- Your car app knows your girlfriend, knows her favorite restaurant 






If you want to eat at a very good seafood restaurant, you can tell the computer. The computer can, um, find out a good restaurant nearby, find out the best optimal route to go there, and knows your favorite foods and places an order and takes you there. And it also plants the exact time so you can minimize the waiting in the restaurant. So the computer can send a message to your phone and hey, I'm ready. Whenever you are ready, the computer can take you to the restaurant, drop you there, go park itself, uh, and then wait for it to finish. And when you're ready, you can tell the computer, hey, I'm done. The computer can pick you up and drop you at home, then go back to the garage park itself, put itself in charge. Why should a computer do? A computer can be your personal concierge person. The car, uh, can be your personal assistant. You don't need another, uh, app on the phone. You don't need another computer or another person. When you have a car, uh, you have a lot of computers with you. Imagine. So that's the future that we are going to if, for that to become a reality, what are the things that needs to happen? First thing, the car should have an ecosystem which allows individual apps to be installed. And those apps, uh, can talk to each other. And those apps needs Internet connectivity. Those apps, we need a way to install those apps. Uh, we need a way to update those apps, we need a way to uninstall those apps. And also, the car needs to talk to all the internal components. The car needs to understand its surrounding. The car needs to plan the route. So it needs to collect the data from the car. So two pillars are used all the time. Suppose the car makes a plan, gets you there, but somewhere it got stuck. And instead of taking you to one restaurant, I couldn't take you to the restaurant, uh, on time. And something is going wrong. We don't want to bring that car, um, into a service center and diagnose the problem. Instead, we could diagnose that remotely. The car itself can send a message to the service center, hey, this is what my owner asked, uh, me to do, and I was stuck here. Can you find out what's going wrong with me? Boom. Now, the service center personnel can remotely diagnose by sending some commands, get the responses, and figure out how this specific app, um, has some issues. So let's update it. And the service center person can initiate over the software update to that car as, uh, well as millions of other cars, right? This is an exciting future that we are talking about, but it's not an easy way. It requires, uh, core engineering challenges to be solved. It requires, um, multiple engineering challenges to be solved before we get there. This is where, uh, C grows. Can help you. We have mastered the art of providing software updates to millions of cars at the same time. We call it the Deep updater. It's not only going to update the, uh, infotainment system or specific parts of the car, you can update literally any ECU, every single ECU inside the cars to collect the data from, uh, the car, to collect the data and make sense of the data. We have deep Logger, uh, that can do that for you, that can collect the data and provide the data via API or other, um, streaming mechanism to your data warehouse. And you can make sense of it. And at the latency that you will wonder, how is this possible? We employ state of the art technology and compression to minimize the amount uh, of data that is transferred between the device and the car. And we have a streamlined a way to transfer the data to your cloud, your data warehouse, and you can make sense of it, or if you want us to run the algorithms, you're happy to run it for you too. And we also have command manager that can send a remote diagnostic request to the cars and, uh, then get a response and then provide the response in a human readable format, not just a cryptic hex. And all these three pillars are, uh, perfected in zebras and are being continuously improved by our current customers and the usage. The more customers we add, the more use cases that we encounter and the more mature our product becomes. So come join us. Let's make an exciting future. Let's make the automotive industry's future exciting. Let's become the, uh, personal concierge for every customer.


When you connect your vehicle to the cloud, to the Internet, you need few basic building blocks. The ability to collect the data from the vehicles, the ability to update, uh, the software in the vehicles, and the ability to remotely diagnose the problems with the vehicles. These three are the pillars or the basic blocks. Once you get these things right and at, uh, scale, you can do anything you want. On top of it, you can build multiple apps, uh, you can build, uh, anything that we have not thought of yet. So far, the automotive industry has transformed from being mechanical and electrical to electronics. Right now, almost all the cars or all the vehicles that are produced in the world today has multiple computers, um, in it. Each computer, uh, a mini computer is responsible for handling a specific functionality of the device. Body controller, vehicle module controller, something like that. These cars, uh, have a hardware component that doesn't change. And these cars have a software component that can change and probably enhance the driver behavior or probably enhance the driving experience of riding that car. Uh, so there is a concept called, uh, driver, uh, centric or software defined the vehicles. But what can a connected car do?
