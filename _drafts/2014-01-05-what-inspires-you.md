Few moments back, I was reading Rhonda Byrnes latest book "The Hero". Though, it was a different flavour of the famous "Law of Attraction" with Gratitude and Visualization, it was interesting to me. While going through the book, the below quote from Mastin Kipp (Page 77) struck me really hard.

> Make a list of people who inspires you, and then write what about that person inspires you. Is it their tenacity? Is it how much they give? Is it their bank account? Is it their brand? Is it what they have done to the world? Then recognize that, the thing that inspires you about that person is actualy a part of yourself.  **-- Mastin Kipp**

What a profund thought? Isnt that true, that we get inspired by watching someone do something great, which we wish we could have done it?. Yes. It is. Whenever I see any inspirational video or read an inspirational post, I wish I was there too. I set out to find who and what inspires me. Trust me, the result revealed so much about what I wanted to do.  

The list of people who inspired me is huge, really huge. I get inspired by people doing small things as well as the greatest feats on the world. Just the impact it has on the world, matters to me. For this exercise, I thought I would list them all and pick the top 10 personalities that inspired me in the last 3 decades.  When you get inspired from wide variety of people it is tough to choose. I leave it to your instinct to choose your top 10. Here is my top 10 sources of inspiration.  

1. Adolf Hitler
2.
