I am proud to be an Indian.

*Nice. I am proud too. It feels good to be Indian.*

I am proud to be an American.

*Great. It's a good country. God bless America.*

...


I am proud to be a Dalit.

*Excuse me?.*  

I am proud to be a Vaishya.

*Are you seriously saying this?*

I am proud to be a Kshatriya.

*Wait... Wait...*

I am proud to be a Brahmin.

*What are you guys talking about?. I can't believe that in this 20th century, people still love to associate themselves with the Caste System.*  

*Caste System is evil. How can you be proud about such an evil thing?.*

What's wrong with the caste system?.

*It is determined by birth. It discriminates people. It puts one group on top of the others. It does not allow people from one caste to move to another caste.*

Hmm.. Very good, thought provoking questions. Why don't you ask the same questions over your nationality?.

How is nationality determined?. - Isn't that by birth?

How do Americans react to people from Islamic countries, Indians react to Pakistani nationals, Israelis react to Palestinians and Srilankans react to Tamil speaking people?.

Isn't that a discrimination?. 

Isn't there an hierarchy?.

In one way, it is better, because you can change your citizenship to any country (though that's not the case all the times).

Are you thinking?. 

OK. Let's come back to the side-effects of Caste System "manifested by us" or "imposed on us" over the years.

Let's assume that, with so much advance in technology and learning, we removed the discrimination in the caste system. Every caste is equal. Every person is equal. You are born into one of your parent's caste by default, however you are free to change to the caste of your choice. You can be a caste free person as well.

What's your stand on the Caste System now?. It's as perfect as your nationality except for the economic and governance support.

*Hmm... It may be a good situation...*

It would be.
