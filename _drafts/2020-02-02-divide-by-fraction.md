I stumbled upon a question recently, *When dividing a number by a fraction, why do we invert and multiply?*. We all know the answer intuitively - *It produces the same result*. Do you know why does it produce the same result?

Let's get the basics straight.

**Multiplication** is the repeated addition of the same number

**Division** is the splitting of number into equal parts

Let's use even numbers to explain the concepts. 

> 4/2 = 2

(i.e.) If you split the number 4 into groups of 2, how many such groups can be created?. 

&#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &#9634; &rarr; | &#9634; &#9634; | &#9634; &#9634; |

> 4/4 = 1

(i.e.) If you split the number 4 into groups of 4, how many such groups can be created?.

> 4/1 = 4

(i.e.) If you split the number 4 into groups of 1, how many such groups can be created?.

So far, everything is clear. What happens when you divide the number by a fraction?

> 4/(1/2) = 8

(i.e.) If you split the number 4 into groups of halves, how many such groups can be created?. 

What's a group of half numbers?. Simple. Split a single number to two equal parts. Put one half in one group.

Please ignore the shape and size of the objects. These are for illustration only. Just count the numbers.

When you divide a number, you are not just grouping the numbers. You spilt the numbers first and then grouping them together. So, the number is actually increased (multiplied)

Let's see what happens when we invert the fraction and multiply?.

> 4 / (1/2) = 4 X 2 = 8

You see the difference?. Multiplication simply adds the number to itself. Division by a fraction, splits the numbers and groups it. The end result is the same.

I hope this explanation helps.
