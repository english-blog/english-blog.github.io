Now, that I have given up Social Media, I have a minimum of 2 additional hours everyday. I didnt realize that I was spending so much of my time in Social Media as soon as I wake up in the morning. The precious first hour of mine was wasted in facebook News Feed - mostly in funny pictures, videos, quotes or in debate about a whole lot of other topics. None of them were productive enough for me.

Now, that I have given up Social Media, I have a lot of free time in the morning and evenings. I wanted to do spend the time productively.

The Big Question that I have to answer every day.

Consume or Create?

The former is easier than the later.

The former is passive and the later is active.

I associated my "Creation" to the impulse that I get to write.
