Imagine, you are in a vast grassland. So vast that the land seem to stretch beyond the horizon. The grass is small and the land is even (comfortably motorable). The weather is good. You see a car parked with full tank of gasoline. You can drive as fast as you want, in any direction you want and as long as the gasoline lasts. There is no destination to reach. You are here to enjoy the ride. You start driving the car, enjoying the music and cool breeze. You are in full control of your life. You feel blissful for the moment.  

After few hours of driving, you start seeing other cars driving in random directions. Some of the cars has drivers. Those drivers claim to know about a beautiful oasis at the end of the horizon. The grassland has nothing else other than food and shelter. Every other convenience has to be built by the people. But, the beautiful oasis has every imaginable luxury, as promised by the drivers. You can go to that oasis on one condition - **You must obey every word of the driver and believe that such a place exists without any doubt.** It is very difficult for you to believe and act in such a way to go to a place that may possibly not exist. And you are not even bothered to go to that place.  

You are surprised to see that so many people do not like or enjoy being in the very grassland where they were born. They want to go to a beautiful oasis with much more luxuries and are ready to let go some of the simple pleasures in the grassland. Some of them do enjoy being in the grassland and at the same time listen to the drivers (practical opportunists). Soon the word of the beautiful oasis spreads out. Each of the cars with drivers are being followed by thousands of other cars.
