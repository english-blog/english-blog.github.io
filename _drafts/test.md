This is the test post that I am writing with the intention to write for 15 mins a day challenge. I dont have any idea on what to write, but I am writing. Why is this very difficult for me to write, when I have nothing to write?. Is this the same case with everyone or just myself?. How do other poeple get inspiration to write consistently on a daily basis, but I get to write only when I am inspired to write?.  

How to go to that level of writing where writing does not feel like a thing to do with conscious will, but like breathing. I should be able to write without any blocks as soon as I sit down to write. I should frequently sit down to write as well. How to find a timeslot in the office where I can sit down to write without affecting my work and also without any issues in helping others?  

What to write on a daily basis?. Shall I blog about the technical issues that I solve on a daily basis?. Shall I write about the technologies that I learn during my work as tutorials?. Shall I blog about the personal development concepts?. Shall I write about the ideas that I have for the future?. Shall I write about the innovation that I want to happen in this world?  

I can and shall write about anything that I want. At this moment, what is the bugging issue in my mind. Java to CMS?. Pothole proof suspension?. Utilizing the bench time effectively?.
