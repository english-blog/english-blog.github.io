You love cooking?. Great. Go on. Read. 

You dont like cooking?. Wait. Read. You may change your mind.

### Mandatory step to cooking

1. Choose the recipe.
2. List down the ingredients. 
3. Calculate the ingredients for the number of people who are going to eat.
4. Go to the market and buy (you need to make sure the produce is fresh)
5. Clean, cut, chop etc. (most time consuming process of cooking, esp. non-veg)
6. Cook. (make an art!)

If you look at it, the majority of your time is spent in preparation, than the actual process of cooking. I remember, my wife spending close to 2 hrs in preparation to cook "Malai Koftha". She was damn tired and very happy at the same time. I loved it, but never asked her to prepare "Malai Koftha" again. I dont want her to strain so much for a dish. If you ever stepped into kitchen, you know it already. The steps 2-5 are what keeps most of us away from the kitchen. At least me and all the guys that I know.  

What if there is a service, which takes care of every aspect of preparation and allows you to enjoy cooking, just cooking?.  

What if that service, makes you to cook gourmet food in your own kitchen?  

It would be amazing. Isnt it?.  

Yeah. The time has come. The place is none other than our own Bengaluru.

Go to this website. Choose the recipe. Choose the no.of people. Order. You are done.

Next day, you will receive a parcel with fresh cut/sliced/chopped vegetables, sliced/cut/minced meat in a clean packaging. The pack all the ingredients in that recipe, right from few spoons of cooking oil to few coriander leaves to sprinkle at the end. Along with that package, would be a printed recipe (step by step instruction to cook your food). You just have to simply cook & enjoy it.  

My wife ordered "Mudaliar Pepper Mutton Fry" on friday night 1 AM. She got a call in the morning 8.30 AM to confirm. They need one day advance order to buy and prepare for us. They do not use frozen meat/vegetables. All are prepared fresh. She was busy with Saturday orders, and still agreed to take our order and deliver it by 1'O Clock. Everyone in the family were very interested to see what's in the package. Never seen such a crowd in the kitchen :)

My wife is extra cautious while cooking meat. She makes sure that the meat is cleaned properly (I do that actually). No need to worry about that anymore. The meat was as clean as I could clean. She just followed the recipe. Cooking was very easy & enjoyable. Since this is a mutton fry, we let it SIM for 45 minutes. End of it, we had a home cooked gourmet recipe, without the usual hassles of cooking. 

Trust me, the taste was amazing. Not sure, if that's because of my wife's touch or because of their service. I would vote for my wife though :P

What made my wife happy was the follow-up call from youjustcook.com to check if the recipe had come out well. I am surprised too !. We are planning to order regularly.

Here is the final dish (We could not wait for the garnishing, we started eating as soon as it is ready)
