Saving Mother Earth!

The necessity of the moment. 

So many non-profit organizations, individuals and governments work tirelessly to protect the forests, prevent many species from extinction, reduce the carbon foot print, invest on renewable energy, reduce global warming etc. There are countless other initiatives which aims to save this beautiful blue planet from extinction.

Great. I appreciate the idea. 

But wait!. Does mother Earth need our help?. Is the planet really dying?. Let's trace back ...  

Our blue little planet was nothing but solar nebula - the disc-shaped cloud of gas and dust left over from the Sun's formation, around 4.6 billion years ago. It took 10 - 20 million years for that cloud to form as the planet Earth and life appeared on its surface within one billion years. We took the form of humans around 200,000 years ago. Life on Earth is highly dependent on the Sun. But, the Sun is not going to last forever. This is the predicted life cycle of our sun. 

If we (humans) survive long enough, we must find another planet to live, and may be keep on switching planets, if needed.

What if there are already some species doing that?.  

In the history of the Earth, 12 ice ages have occurred so far and scientific community expects another one as soon as 20,000 years. May be sooner, if we continue to heat up. Earth has gone through many cycles of extreme climates. Fortunately, the climate is consistently stable in the last 7000 years during which the human civilizations around the world emerged and prospered.  

Life on Earth has suffered occasional mass extinctions at least since 542 million years ago. These mass extinctions have actually accelerated the evolution of life. Simply the dominance is passed over from one species to another. The best example is the dominance and the extinction of the Dinosaurs.  It is not the strongest that survives, but the one that adapts itself to the changing environment. Every species in this world has undergone changes (mutations) to suit themselves to the environment.  

When it comes to human beings, it’s different. We learnt to control the environment, which no other species has ever done before. We interrupted the natural cycle of energy. We did not contribute to the renewal of natural resources and kept on consuming it. We understand the process now, but not ready to give up everything and go back to the golden cave days.
