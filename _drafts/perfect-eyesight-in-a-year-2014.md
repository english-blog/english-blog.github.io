title: Perfect Eyesight In A Year

I still remember the day me & my brother Pradeep tried to read the smallest text from farthest distance. I could read a very fine print from 4 feet away. My eyesight was better than my younger brothers. Two decades later, he still has a very good vision; but mine detoriated to -3.5 diopters in both eyes (Myopia). I never imagined that this would happen.  

I regularly misplace my eyeglasses somewhere in our house and would need my wifes help to find the glasses. Worst thing is that, without glasses I cant even recognize my wife from six feet away. I am tired of this dependency with glasses. I am going to get the perfect 20/20 vision or better by the end of 2014. I am going to achieve this by natural means only (eye exercises, nutrition, mental conditioning, natural healing methods etc). 
### Eye Exercises

How can I be so confident in achieving the perfect eyesight?. Beacuse I know. I attended a weeklong free training at [The School for Perfect Eyesight][school-url], Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Pondicherry, way back in Sep 2009. This training is based on Dr. Bates Method. With the simple exercises mentioned below, my eyesight was improved from -3.00 diopters to -2.75 diopters in both the eyes. In just one week!. The training required little bit of determination (two times in a day and no glasses are allowed throughout the week). The teachers advised me to continue the training for atleast 6 months and avoid wearing glasses in all possible times. I did not follow that advise. Result? - Now with -3.5 diopters. I provided the links for each of the exercises below. 

1. [SUN TREATMENT][1]
2. [WASHING][2]
3. [PALMING][3]
4. [READING FINE PRINT IN CANDLE-LIGHT][4]
5. [SWING][5]
6. [GAME OF BALL][6]
7. [DISTANT CHART READING][7]
8. [VAPOUR][8]
9. [COLD PACK][9]

Completing all the exercises would take aorund 45 minutes. Just to keep the ritual simple and consistent, I may not do all these exercises daily.   
Exercises 1 & 2 - reserved for sunny days.  
Exercises 3 - 7 on a daily basis.  
Exercises 8 & 9 - as and when time permits.

I will add other exercises, if time is available on a specific day.


### During Office hours

Since I work with computers for more than 8 hours a day, I must wear glasses all the time, I am in office. Which is not suggested by Dr. William H. Bates.



### Nutrition

### Natural Supplements

### Accu-Pressure

### Emotional Freedom Technique
