OK. OK. I get it. Hold On.

This is not another get-rich-quick-without-doing-anything scheme.

I am not here to teach you anything either.

This is a simple experiment to test if EFT would work in the area of abundance.

I wrote a [blogpost]({{site.url}}/the-eft-manual-cary-craig-book-review/) about EFT, almost 3 years back. I have used EFT on and off with considerable success for many emotional issues and physical discomforts. So, I know it works like magic in certain areas. Today morning, when I was browsing through youtube videos, I stumbled across this video from Margaret Lynch. She is a well known coach in EFT. She produce this simple video to remove the block to having 50000 dollars in your bank account.
