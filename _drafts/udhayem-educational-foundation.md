> Education is the most powerful weapon which you can use to change the world. - **Nelson Mandela**

As we all know, there are hundreds of charities and NGOs working towards the education of the underprivileged students in and around Chennai. Some of the NGOs are really service oriented and many others are money oriented (major chunk of the donations are used as administrative cost). There was a group of ordinary people with not so good paying jobs, but really wanted to help students in their locality. They started collecting money from friends and families and donated to few of the charities and NGOs to empower kids with education. However, after donating the money they did not know how the donated money was spent or how it changed the peoples lives. They were not able to see the impact. The human element - "Satisfaction in helping others" was missing. 

So, they rolled up their sleeves and got into the field. These friends (Sendhil, Karthik, Prithvi, Suriya, Santhosh & Prem) created this trust "Udhayem Educational Foundation" to help the underprivileged students to continue with their education, by helping them with tuition fee, uniform, stationery etc. Even though my name is in the founders list, I was a very silent and inactive member of this trust. Our friends go to the local schools & find out what is the immediate need for the school and fulfill that. Sometimes, we get to know about a good student struggling to pay the tuition fee, we would help them. There is no defined criteria as to which cases can be helped and which cases should not. As long as it helps in education, we are fine. This trust is registered with the Government of Tamil Nadu. Any donations to this trust will get you tax exemption under 80C section. 

The differentiating factor between UEF and other 

Below are some of the projects completed by UEF

So far, we collect money only from friends and relatives and were able to help few students. Its time now to expand the horizons.
