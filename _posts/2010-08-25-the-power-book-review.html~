"You are meant to have an amazing life"<br />
<br />
Irish-Australian writer Rhonda Bryne, was once a producer of reality-TV shows in Australia who is now a multi-millionaire living in a Beverley Hills mansion, next door to Oprah Winfrey. She became so, with her best selling book &amp; DVD, "The Secret". She comes with a sequel "The Power", which is expected to sell atleast 20 million copies, out of which 2 million copies are printed and almost sold out. So, whats in this book?. Lets do a fair, really fair review of the book.<br />
<br />
"Take away love and our earth is a tomb" - Robert Browning (1812-1889)<br />
<br />
"If the only prayer that you ever say in your life is - 'thank you' - that is enough" - Meister Eckhart (1260-1328)<br />
<br />
"Give, and it will be given to you... for by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you in return" - Jesus.<br />
<br />
"Everything is possible for the person who believes" - Jesus.<br />
<br />
I can summarize the entire book into these four keywords. Love, Gratitude, Giving and Belief. (Which almost all religions in the world preaches). She claims that the book is complete in itself and doesn't need formal knowledge. I disagree. Lets trace back the history.<br />
<br />
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@ (Kollywood style symbol for flashback :)<br />
<br />
In 2004, She was in the biggest financial crisis of her lifetime, then she got the book "The Science of getting rich" by Wallace D. Wattles which transformed her life. She wanted to tell the truth to entire world, researched the history, found a lot of information and created the DVD "The Secret" with the help of world's well known motivational speakers in 2006. She was the producer and did a pretty good job. The DVD was a phenomenal hit and the book "The Secret" is translated into 46 languages. <br />
<br />
I was introduced to "The Law of Attraction (LOA)" through this DVD. LOA says "Like attracts like. Good, happy &amp; positive feelings will attract positive people, circumstances and events and vice versa". <br />
LOA comprises of the two important things<br />
1. Visualizations, belief &amp; feelings<br />
2. ACTION.<br />
The DVD doesn't talk even a word about ACTION. You CANNOT attract million dollars, just by lying in the bed and imagining. Trust me, it doesn't work, because I tried it. Even with so many stories and real life examples in the DVD, I was surprised. I thought its superstitious and doesn't work.<br />
<br />
I like Dr. Joe Vitale &amp; John Assaraf from the DVD and I still closely following them for any piece of advice. It was then, I found another audio book "The Missing Secret" by Dr. Joe Vitale which completed the puzzle, by stressing the importance of ACTION to acheive any of your dreams. Still, believing that there is something more powerful than us, doing things for us (if we just ask) doesnt make sense to me. Dr. Joe Vitale is more of a spiritual person, so I just took only the key advices from him.<br />
<br />
Later, I found another book "The Answer" by John Assaraf - who flabbergasted me with the scientific explanations (with citations and references) about how things work in LOA. He was so clear that he explained whatever science could prove and told us clearly the portions which are under research still. Since he is a self made millionaire and entrepreneur, you can see his quest for scientific answers throughout this book. This book has initial few chapters dedicated to LOA and science and the rest of the chapters about building the dream business.<br />
<br />
To me, Dr. Joe Vitale and John Assaraf stood as authors who actually tells the truth and Rhonda Bryne, just ignores the KEY information for the sake of better screen play in the DVD.<br />
<br />
End of the story. I hope now you know the background!<br />
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@<br />
<br />
So, I was curious whats special with this new book?. The printed book was heavy and colorful with lovely designs. The Law of Attraction was renamed as "The Law of Love". The importance of Love, Gratitude, Giving and Belief is stressed with different set of quotes from world leader, religions etc. Apart from few extra tips and techniques, there is NOTHING new in this book. May be that, she categorized how to have good health, relationships and money etc in different chapters, which is not available in "The Secret".<br />
<br />
How about the writing style?. Crap. Most of the self-help books re-iterate few key points throughout the book, so that it goes deep into the reader's mind. This was used very heavily and becomes irritating so much that, I tend to skip the paragraphs. There are people who compares the "success" of this book and Harry Potter. From writer's perspective, She cannot even come close to Rowling.<br />
<br />
Why is that a book review about a most sought after positive thinking book, sounds very negative (which is the very first thing that the author doesnt want you to do). Its because, First - I was so excited, pre-ordered the book that I am gonna get a lot of useful information and didnt find much. Second - I just want to give my honest feedback to the author, so that She can improve and to the reader, that they will know what to expect.<br />
<br />
<b>To Rhonda Bryne:</b> Please improve your writing style. Reduce lot of repetitive sentences. I am sure that a newbie to self-help, wouldn't understand much from this book alone. So, don't claim something which your book doesn't do.<br />
<br />
<b>To the readers:</b> I would suggest the following sequence, if you really want to know what's happening around.<br />
1. The Secret - DVD by Rhonda Bryne<br />
2. The Missing Secret - Audio book by Dr. Joe Vitale<br />
3. The Answer - Book by John Assaraf<br />
<br />
Once you are done with these, please read "The Power" by Rhonda Bryne and I am sure you would share my thoughts. Here is one interesting review about this book. Very funny. Please read all the comments as well :)<br />
