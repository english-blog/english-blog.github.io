comments: false
excerpt: If you speak in Japanese to a Chinese, he would not understand. So, does speaking in Tamil to native Indians. Its as simple as that. People feel loved when we express love in a way that they can understand. Dr. Chapman categorizes these variations in expressing love to five categories. He starts with the emotional "In-Love" experience and why that experience fades away slowly after marriage and points out what's missing. Its not that we do not love each other anymore, its just that we consistently fail to communicate love in a way that he/she understands it. Great.

If you speak in Japanese to a Chinese, he would not understand. So, does speaking in Tamil to native Indians. Its as simple as that. People feel loved when we express love in a way that they can understand. Dr. Chapman categorizes these variations in expressing love to five categories. He starts with the emotional "In-Love" experience and why that experience fades away slowly after marriage and points out what's missing.

Your love language and your spouses may not be the same and it could be difficult for you to learn and speak your spouse's language. But, do learn. The results are amazing.  
  
The five love languages are:  
  
**1. Words of Affirmation:** Simple words of affirmation/appreciation from your heart. Appreciating the simple things that your spouse does for you. For some people, words mean much more than anything else in the world. These simple appreciations goes a long way in building that special relationship that everyone longs for.  
  
**2. Quality Time:** By quality time, he means giving your undivided attention to your spouse frequently. May be sitting with her in the couch and talking to her for 15 minutes a day (remember to switch off the TV). Listen. Let her talk. Don't give solutions, if she did not ask for it. Learning to listen could be difficult for many men. On an average we could listen for 7 seconds, before we pump our thoughts into the discussion. Just listen. Or just spend time with her. Go for a walk. Do things together.As simple as that. For many women, this means a lot. Quality time during the extreme happiness and during crisis will remain in her memory till her last breath.  
  
**3. Receiving Gifts:** The gifts need not be expensive and we know that everyone cannot afford. But, gifts are the token of love which remains for a long time. You could pick up the flower in the back yard. Make a gift card by yourself or enroll yourself in an art class, just for creating a gift for her. Gift her and touch her heart and you get everything from her :)  
  
**4. Acts of Service:** Some people express their love to their spouse by service. Jesus is a perfect example of this type. For some, giving gifts or spending time with her or praising her wont mean much, when the house is a mess, clothes all over the rooms and the yards need maintenance. So, if your spouses love language is Acts of Service, the only way to her heart is by doing things for her. May be, cleaning the dishes, doing the laundry and taking care of the baby when she is not well etc,.  
  
**5. Physical Touch:** Most men misunderstand that this is their primary language. By Physical Touch, Dr. Chapman doesn't refer only Sexual Intercourse. Of coursethat'smost important for almost every men. But, need not necessarily be your primary love language. This language means holding the hands together, hugging, kissing, rubbing the back, sitting close in the couch and feeling great when your partner touches you (even in the day when you don't have sex).  
  
Dr. Chapman provides a quiz & scoring system for men and women at the end to help us identify our primary love language. Many of us will be bi-lingual and multilingual. Understand your primary love language and your spouse's love language and speak love. Happy Married Life !!!
