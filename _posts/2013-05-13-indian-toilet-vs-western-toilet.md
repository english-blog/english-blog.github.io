I came back from the UK recently and have to stay in my friend's home which has only Indian Toilet (Squatting Type). When I was using Indian Toilet - Whoosh... the whole business took less than 2 minutes and it was effortless. I normally take 5 - 10 minutes while using a Western Toilet. Once I moved to my apartment which has a Western Toilet (Sitting Type), going to the bathroom was not a breeze anymore. That triggered this research about the natural human defecating postures.  
  
It's not that I am new to Indian Toilets. I have been using it since my childhood. I started using Western Toilets about 9 years ago. Only when I got a chance to use the Indian and Western, one after the other - I could realize the difference. Have a look at the below diagram which shows the anal-rectal angle, while sitting and squatting. I don't need to explain which one would be a better posture for this job.

### What's Next

* Install an Indian toilet (or any eastern-type squatting toilet) in your home. 
* Use a Squat Toilet Utility like Squatty Potty. You don't need to pay so much for a simple device. There are cheaper alternatives available in the market. Just google. I never used this personally. So, I cannot comment on this. Just try, if you cannot do option 1.
