I urge everyone to watch this movie, irrespective of your Hindi knowledge. The only sentence that I can speak with confidence in Hindi is, "Mera naam Prem. Aapka naam kya hei?". Seriously, that's all I know. The language doesn't matter. Watch it with the subtitles, like I did.

I am not here to review the movie or rate it. This movie triggered a lot of emotions in me. We are all running behind something, running for more money, running for promotions, running for a big house, running to have a peaceful retirement, running to die rich - while forgetting the whole reason behind it - **Life**.

Why most of us spend their youthful days of their life in corporate cubicles and hoping to have peaceful life after they retire?.

Why do we content ourselves with three weeks of vacation per year and get into the rat race for the rest of the year?.

Why do we spend so much money in big houses, keeping ourselves locked to the mortgage?.

Why do we get into bad relationships to keep others happy, knowing deep inside that we don't want this relationship?.

Why don't we take the road less traveled?.

Why can't we simply live for ourselves?.

Why can't we simply live?.

I am not asking everyone to stop everything and backpack to Europe or Australia. I just wish, if everyone could do only the things that makes them happy from inside. (at least most of the time).

**What inspired me the most from this movie?.**

I liked the entire movie, but one question struck me hard... really hard that I paused and sunk into deep thoughts.

**Do you write anything to feed your own soul?**

I always thought myself as a writer. A fearless writer, who writes for his soul. But, when I confronted this explicit question - I couldn't say YES with my whole heart.

I felt connected to my soul, when I wrote poems for my love.

I felt connected to my soul, when I wrote my experiences, experiments in life.

I felt connected to my soul, when I wrote about topic which are close to my heart - being vegan, experiencing god and science, running etc.

Along with that,

I write tech blogs - which does not interest me, but I do it for my professional growth.

I write book reviews - which was interesting in the beginning, but slowly becoming a mandatory event after reading every book.

I wrote and deleted many blog posts - simply because many of them are about controversial topics, time sensitive, non-conclusive, exhibits negativity, may not be helpful to anyone etc. 

I can say now, that I write for my soul and also for others.

The question now is,

**Should I write for others?.**

Why not?.

**Should this thought of "writing for others" limit my writings?.**

No. Definitely No.

**What does this mean to this blog?**

I am going to make this blog as a creative outlet for my thirst to write. It's going to record every aspect of me and my thoughts. It could be trash most of the time. I don't care.  The trash is not for you. There could be golden nuggets here and there. If that interests you, read it, enjoy it. Else, just ignore this blog and do something worthy.

> Many beautiful realizations happens at the most unexpected moments in our life.

Thanks to the movie makers.
