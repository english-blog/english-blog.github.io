excerpt: Not a poet, but an off tune mind that dares to speak in free verse. That's how Shreya writes in the preface. I completely agree with her. I had huge expectation before reading this book. But, I was disappointed. Since, this is her first book on poetry, I am OK. I guess, She should have waited for some more time to improve her skills, get feedback from different sources (not just friends), refine her skills and then should have come to the publishing world. Print media is completely different from the blog media. Once printed, it stays in history. Instead of publishing all she has written, she should have selected the best few and make a best first impression.

"*Not a poet, but an off tune mind that dares to speak in free verse.*" - That's how Shreya writes in the preface. I completely agree with her. I had huge expectation before reading this book. But, I was disappointed. Since, this is her first book on poetry, I am OK. I guess, She should have waited for some more time to improve her skills, get feedback from different sources (not just friends), refine her skills and then should have come to the publishing world. Print media is completely different from the blog media. Once printed, it stays in history. Instead of publishing all she has written, she should have selected the best few and make a best first impression.  
  
Poems - to me is a mean to convey the feelings from one mind to another. The scene, the situation, the movie, the characters should expand in our mind, when we read the poems. We should feel that we are part of what's happening or at least we are witnessing it. That feeling is missing in most of the poems. Some of the poems read like news. However, I like some of the poems. Here are few of my likes ...  
  
1. The last company in the park  
2. A girl scribbling  
3. I will be around  
4. Blood  
5. A brother to me. (I liked this very much. I can co-relate myself to this poem)  
  
I could have simply written a review "nice book", "good to read" etc. Would that help Shreya?. I don't think so. Whatever I told is what I felt after reading the book. The reason I am very much disappointed is that my friends Sunita and Binti also write poems. They are awesome. But they are least bothered either to blog it or publish it. So, when I have a printed book in my hand, I think you can guess my expectations.  
  
Shreya - Sometime down the line, I expect another poetry book from you. My review of that book should have only one word "awesome". All the best !
