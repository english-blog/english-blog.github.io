I still remember the day I & my brother tried to read the smallest text from the farthest distance. I could read a very fine print from 4 feet away. My eyesight was better than my younger brother. Two decades later, he still has a very good vision; but mine deteriorated to -3.5 diopters in both eyes (Myopia). I never imagined that this would happen.  

I regularly misplace my eyeglasses somewhere in our house and would need my wife's help to find the glasses. The worst thing is that without glasses I can't even recognize my wife from six feet away. I am tired of this dependency with glasses. I am going to get the perfect 20/20 vision or better by the end of 2014. I am going to achieve this by natural means only (eye exercises, nutrition, mental conditioning, natural healing methods etc).   

There are too many products and procedures out there, claim to improve my eyesight. I don't want to try all of them. I selected the below means (mostly by references from friends and my own experiences). I need to have a specific plan which I can stick to, on a daily basis. Lovely thing is that I don't have one. I am going to juggle through these items and eventually find a perfect plan for me. Only one strict rule - I must do at least one of these, every day.  

### Eye Exercises

How can I be so confident that eye exercises help?. Because I know. I attended a week-long free training at [The School for Perfect Eyesight][school-url], Sri Aurobindo Ashram, Pondicherry, way back in Sep 2009. This training is based on Dr. Bates Method. With the simple exercises mentioned below, my eyesight was improved from -3.00 diopters to -2.75 diopters in both the eyes. In just one week!. The training required a little bit of determination (two times in a day and no glasses are allowed throughout the week). The teachers advised me to continue the training for at least 6 months and avoid wearing glasses at all possible times. I did not follow that advise. Result? - Now with -3.5 diopters.

Completing all the exercises would take around 45 minutes. Just to keep the ritual simple and consistent, I will not do all these exercises daily.   

Exercises 1 - reserved for sunny days.  
Exercises 2 - 7 on a daily basis.  
Exercises 8 & 9 - as and when time permits.  

### During Office hours

Since I work with computers, I must wear glasses all the time while I am in the office, which is not suggested by Dr. William H. Bates. I don't know any other way at this moment. But I am going to follow few other tips in the office to reduce the strain caused by the computer screen.  

**20-20-20 Trick** - Take a break every 20 minutes and focus on an object 20 feet away for 20 minutes. Very simple, but very effective.  

**Turn down brightness** - Reduce the brightness of the computer screen to the lowest possible limit. You should still be able to see the screen clearly without squinting, but you should not feel like staring at a bright light. This is a one-time activity & I got used to the low light in a day.  

**Wash Eyes Regularly** - When working on computers for a long time, it is advised to wash our eyes 3 - 4 times during the day with ordinary water or saline water. I bought two eye cups (google - you can get it for few dollars) - one for home and another for office. I will use the regular drinking water for washing eyes. I am thinking about doing this, whenever I use the washrooms. If this is not possible, just sprinkling water would help.  

### Pinhole Glasses

Merchants claim that wearing pinhole glasses for 15 minutes a day will improve your eyesight. Ophthalmologists refuse that this is not possible. Neither of them is ready to do a clinical trial. User reviews are mixed (as with any product or service). I don't know, if this would improve my eyesight and if that improvement would be permanent. The only way to find the truth is to try it. I ordered it. I will follow up with a review of this product. I am planning to use this glass while reading books (at least 15 Minutes a day).  

### Nutrition

Just like bodybuilding, retraining the eyes to see normally requires more than just exercises. Nutrition. American Optometry Associations website mentions that the below nutrients are needed to maintain good eye health.  

1. Vitamin A
2. Vitamin C
3. Vitamin E
4. Lutein-Zeaxanthin
5. Zinc
6. Essential Fatty Acids (Linoleic acid & Alpha-Linoleic acid)

I am planning to have at least one meal or snack every day which has all of these nutrients. I collected the top 10 foods in each nutrient and put them together in this [text file]({{ site.download-path }}/nutrients-for-eyesight.txt). Please feel free to use this file as a reference.  

### Other means?

These are all the things that are in my mind, right now. I may add other practices, products for improving my eyesight as I get to know more. If you know any tips that could help me, please let me know.  

### School For Perfect EyeSight - Additional Information
