**Me**: "Ara, You should read everyday."  
**My daughter**: Hmm... Okay... 😏 😏 😏

Nothing changed.

"I used to read a lot of books, but not anymore."

That was one of the coaching conversation, which revealed a lot about my hesitation towards reading. After few intense self-introspections, I was able to renew my love for books. I started reading books in Kindle in the bed, next to my daughter. I felt good to me.

Still, nothing changed.

After a couple of months of my daughter watching me read every night, she asked, "Do you have kids books in Kindle?". I said, "Of course, what would you like to read?". I downloaded a few books and gave the kindle to her. She started reading. In a couple more months, she wanted to read physical books. I've ordered the bookset by Roald Dahl, her favorite author.

Fast forward now, we have a small library. My daughter designed a hanging bookshelf for her, started making custom handmade bookmarks for me, and reads everyday including the weekends.

Everything has changed. 😍 😍 😍
