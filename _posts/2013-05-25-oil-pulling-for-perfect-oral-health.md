The more I research about natural lifestyle, the more I come to know. The recent one is "Oil Pulling". I am excited !..  
  
## What is Oil Pulling?
  
It's an ancient Ayurvedic practice for maintaining perfect oral health. As soon as you wake up in the morning, take a table spoon of sesame oil in your mouth and swish it around inside your mouth slowly for 15-20 mins. The Sesame Oil will turn into milky white liquid. Spit that out. Wash your mouth with water. That's all. Simple. Isn't it?.  
  
## Things to take care:
  
* Do it slowly for the full 20 minutes. It takes time for the Oil to mix with saliva and start the cleansing process. You can read or do any other activity while oil pulling.  
* Be conscious, NOT to swallow the liquid while swishing it inside the mouth.  
* Sesame Oil is recommended in Ayurvedic text. The recent studies says that sunflower oil is also equally good. Many people love to do oil pulling with Coconut Oil also. You can try with different oils. Just make sure that it is cold pressed and extra virgin.  
* If your jaws pain after the oil pulling session, you are doing it too vigorously. Slow down.  
  
## Benefits of Oil Pulling:  
  
The most immediate one that you will notice in a weeks time is whiter teeth and free from bad breath. I am doing this for the past one week and I could already see my teeth getting whiter. Though there is not much of scientific study or clinical trials with oil pulling, there is a compelling collection of data from peoples testimonials (highly unreliable, but there are too many to simply discard). Below is a list of some of the most common conditions people have reported that respond to oil pulling.  

* Acne  
* Allergies  
* Arthritis  
* Asthma  
* Back and Neck Pain (???)  
* Bad Breath  
* Bronchitis  
* Chronic Fatigue  
* Colitis  
* Crohn's Disease  
* Constipation  
* Dental Cavities  
* Dermatitis  
* Diabetes (Wow !!!)  
* Eczema  
* Hemorrhoids  
* Hypertension  
* Insomnia (WTF?)  
* Migraine Headaches  
* Mucous Congestion  
* Peptic Ulcers  
* PMS  
* Periodontal Disease  
* Bleeding Gums  
* Sinusitis  
* Tooth Abscess  

I have read a whole bunch of articles about ayurvedic notion of mouth being linked with other organs of the body. They claim that the perfect oral health helps to cure many diseases of the body. There are evidences and testimonials as well. But some how I am not convinced with the idea. If you have any one of those, please try oil pulling for few months (I would suggest 6 months) and let me know, if the symptoms are reduced.  
  
## Why did I start doing Oil Pulling?
  
After moving back to India, there were quite a big change to my raw vegan diet. I traveled a lot and missed a lot of meals during that time. I missed lunches in office due to work. I could not get Good Spinach for Smoothies. The greens available here are too heavy for smoothies. I was surviving mostly on fruits & vegetables only. I know, I need to get back on track. Currently, I am researching Indian raw vegan recipes.  
  
Among all these, One of my tooth in the front lower jaw started bleeding a little regularly during brushing. Out of nowhere, I got to know about Oil Pulling and I started immediately. Believe me or not, the bleeding stopped on the third day !!!. I will continue to do oil pulling as much as I can and post a follow-up blog after few months.  
  
This is a very simple and cheap therapy. There is no harm in trying this. Please try for a week at least !
