The more I research about the natural lifestyle, the more I come to know. The recent one is "Oil Pulling". I am excited !.  
  
### What is Oil Pulling?
  
It's an ancient Ayurvedic practice for maintaining perfect oral health. As soon as you wake up in the morning, take a tablespoon of sesame oil in your mouth and swish it around inside your mouth slowly for 15-20 minutes. The Sesame Oil will turn into milky white liquid. Spit that out. Wash your mouth with water. That's all. Simple. Isn't it?.  
  
### Things to take care
  
* Do it slowly for the full 20 minutes. It takes time for the Oil to mix with saliva and start the cleansing process. You can read or do any other activity while oil pulling.  
* Be conscious, NOT to swallow the liquid while swishing it inside the mouth.  
* Sesame Oil is recommended in the Ayurvedic text. Many people love to do oil pulling with Coconut Oil also. You can try with different oils. Just make sure that it is cold pressed and extra virgin.  
* If your jaws pain after the oil pulling session, you are doing it too vigorously. Slow down.  
  
### Benefits of Oil Pulling
  
The most immediate one that you will notice in a weeks time is whiter teeth and free from bad breath. I am doing this for the past one week and I could already see my teeth getting whiter. Though there is not much of scientific study or clinical trials with oil pulling, there is a compelling collection of data from peoples testimonials (highly unreliable, but there are too many to simply discard). I have read a whole bunch of articles about the Ayurvedic notion of mouth being linked with other organs of the body. They claim that the perfect oral health helps to cure many diseases of the body. I am not convinced with the idea. You can try and see for yourself.
