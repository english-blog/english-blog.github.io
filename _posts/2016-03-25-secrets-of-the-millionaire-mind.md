## Introduction  

This section follows the same old self-help books template. It's about how broke the author was, the things he did wrong, the turning point in his life, how he found the magical key, how he succeeded in his business and achieved financial freedom. Now, the author knows the exact techniques to create wealth. He wants to teach us all to make us rich - for a small fee. The regular self-help template. You may be bored. I was bored. The only reason that I continued reading is my friend Yogesh. He attended T. Harv Eker's *Millionaire Mind Intensive* seminar, a couple of years ago and he was raving about him back then. I thought the author may have something in this book. He did not disappoint me. I got more than what I expected. So, I suggest - keep reading.  

## Your Money Blueprint  

In this section, he talks about money blueprint - the collection of past experiences and knowledge about money, which sets how much money you can have/handle at any point in your life. Your blueprint equals to your current earning. However, it acts like a thermostat. You can increase it to any level that you desire. He guides us to identify our money blueprint; trace that blueprint's roots (specific incidents that caused it) and remove it, if it is not conducive to your wealth game.  

I was awestruck when he hits the bullâ€™s eye when talking about the couples/partners with money issues. This is the exact paragraph from the book.  

> The only thing we ever fought about was money. What we didn't know at the time was that the meaning each of us attributed to money was radically different. To my wife, money meant immediate pleasure (as in enjoying her ice cream). I, on the other hand, grew up with the belief that money was meant to be accumulated as a means to create freedom.

I never realized the blueprint aspect of spending. I felt that my wife spends a lot because she was careless. But, it is not the case. It's just that her blueprint is different than mine. She has no emotions/thoughts associated with saving money. It's not her fault.  

*What a revelation!!!*   

Thank you, Harv Eker. This one information made my day. I and my wife started consciously working to align our money blueprint as much as we could so that we can sail together happily forever. There is a wealth of information about making wealth in this book. Just dive in.  

He also talks about *declarations*. Reading your intentions out loud, so that your body and mind align with the same vibration of your thought/intention. He has written many declarations and asks you read them loud when you are reading through the paragraphs. Just do it. It feels good.  

## The Wealth Files

In this section, the author talks about 17 ways the rich differ from the poor and the middle class. This will be synonymous with the book *Rich Dad and Poor Dad*, in his own flavor. I am not going to detail all of them. The author has done a pretty good job in this book. I will simply list them here for a quick reference (for me as well).  

**Wealth principle 1** - Rich people believe **I create my life**. Poor people believe **life happens to me**.  

**Wealth principle 2** - Rich people play the money game to win. Poor people play the money game to **not** lose.

**Wealth principle 3** - Rich people are **committed** to being rich. Poor people, **want** to be rich.

**Wealth principle 4** - Rich people think big. Poor people think small.

**Wealth principle 5** - Rich people focus on opportunities. Poor people focus on obstacles.

**Wealth principle 6** - Rich people admire other rich and successful people. Poor people resent rich and successful people.

**Wealth principle 7** - Rich people associate with positive and successful people. Poor people associate with negative and unsuccessful people.

**Wealth principle 8** - Rich people are willing to promote themselves and their value. Poor people think negatively about selling and promotion.

**Wealth principle 9** - Rich people are bigger than their problem. Poor people are smaller than their problem.

**Wealth principle 10** - Rich people are excellent receivers. Poor people are poor receivers.

**Wealth principle 11** - Rich people choose to get paid based on results. Poor people choose to get the paid based on time.

**Wealth principle 12** - Rich people think **both**. Poor people think **either/or**.

**Wealth principle 13** - Rich people focus on their net worth. Poor people focus on their working income.

I started my career as a software developer more than a decade ago. I earn more than 10 times the salary that I started with. The monthly income is very comfortable for my family. After reading this wealth file, I calculated my net worth. I did not expect to see a negative number there. I actually owe more money to others than other owe to me. This did not feel good. Even though I earn in millions (in Indian rupees), my net worth is negative. I did a complete retrospection of all aspects of my financial life. Harv Eker suggests recalculating your net worth every month. He even provides a free template to do that. I made few financial decisions to help me improve my net worth.  

Thank You, Harv Eker !!!  

**Wealth principle 14** - Rich people manage their money well. Poor people mismanage their money well.

Along with net worth calculation, he suggests funneling your monthly income to different accounts designated for different purposes.  

10% to Financial Freedom Account - Money just goes in and never comes out for spending. It's only re-invested.  

10% to Play/Fun Account - Strictly for special expenses that makes you feel super good. It must be spent in the same month.  
*(If you are saving every penny, you are going to stop somewhere. If you are spending every single penny, you are going to be broke. These two accounts help you to maintain a healthy balance)*  

10% to Give Account - To charities or to help the people in need. Giving makes you feel that you have more.   

10% to Education Account - Strictly for educational purposes (Books, Courses, Seminars etc.)  

10% to Long-Term Savings for Spending Account.  

50% to Necessities Account.  

From the previous net worth calculation, it is clear that I need to learn to manage my money well. So, I decided to start Financial Freedom Account and Play/Fun Account. Let's see how it goes after few months.  

**Wealth principle 15** - Rich people have the money work hard for them. Poor people work hard for the money.

**Wealth principle 16** - Rich people act in spite of fear. Poor people let their stop them.

**Wealth principle 17** - Rich people constantly learn and grow. Poor people think they already know.


### Interesting quotes from the book:

* Never have a ceiling on your income.

* Your income can grow only to the extent you do.

* When you are in debt, don't buy anymore.

* To master money, you must manage money.

* The habit of managing your money is more important than the amount.

* For every giver, there must be a  receiver and for every receiver that must be a giver.

* Money will make you only more of what you already are.

* If you are willing to do only what is easy, life will be hard. But if you are willing to do what's hard, life will be easy.

This book changed my lifestyle. I know that it is for good. This book may have something for you as well. Just read. I am so happy that I chose to read this book. Thank you, Harv Eker. Meet you in the upcoming Millionaire Mind Intensive seminar. !!!
