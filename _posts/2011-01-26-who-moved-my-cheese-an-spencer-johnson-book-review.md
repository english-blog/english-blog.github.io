**Book:** Who Moved My Cheese?  
**Author:** Spencer Johnson  
**ISBN-13:** 978-0091816971

A little book with a little story. What's so special in this book, that it sold for more than 26 million copies and still being printed?. I knew this book almost 6 years back. I was not that much into reading back then. But, when I saw this book again in the library after so many years, I felt like the book voluntarily re-appeared in my life for a purpose, maybe a message that I need it very badly. Sounds very silly, that too from an atheist. But that's what I felt for true. I started reading to figure out what it has for me. 
  
The story is simple. There is a maze of cheeses stored somewhere and four characters. Two mice, "Sniff" & "Scurry" and two little men "Hem" and "Haw". All of them starts their day looking for cheese. All four characters are different.  
  
**Sniff** - Who sniffs out changes early  
**Scurry** - Who jumps into action no matter what (no hesitation)  
**Hem** - Who denies and resists the change all the time  
**Haw** - Who learns to adapt to the change.  
  
One fine day, there is no cheese and all four have to venture into the unknown (the maze) to find new cheese. How these four characters react to that change?. End of story. A story as simple as a bedtime story to a kid. The baseline of the story is that "Change" is good for all walks of life. So, enjoy the journey into the unknown (life).  
  
But, whats so unique in this story is the characterization. We, every one of us falls into one of these four characters or a mix of these characters in different areas of life. When the story unfolds, we get a lot of inspirational quotes from the author. In one instance, Hem says "*I want my own Cheese back and I am not going to change until I get what I want*" even when she knows that there is no cheese in store. The one meant more to me is this...

I read out loud those words. Many times in our life, we hold on to some relationships, jobs, situations etc which doesn't make us happy anymore or sometimes doesn't even belong to us. Moving on to the next, adventuring through the unknown territory is what keeps us alive. I learned to live, today. Thanks to Spencer Johnson for his little book and big wisdom.  
  
Reading more and more books and reasoning them, teaches me one simple lesson. Every book you read has a message for you if you are open to learning them. Many critics tell that this is just a simple story and people are very mad about this. Understand this please, it's not the story which changes the reader's life, its the individual's interpretation that causes the impact.  
  
So, read this little book. If you get something out of this, Great. Else, read more books :)
