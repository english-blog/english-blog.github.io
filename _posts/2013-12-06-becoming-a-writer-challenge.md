> "I hate writing, I love having written." ― **Dorothy Parker**

Me?. Becoming a Writer? Yes. That has been in my mind for many years. I simply lived as Dorothy quoted above, wishing myself having written the best books that I read. I write only when I am inspired to write. Even then, there are times when I drift off from the original idea or my idea gets refined during the writing process and I no longer believe in that idea. Yes. This is true. You get clearer when you write down your idea and proofread what you have written. I evaluate every blog post that I write, for two things.  

1. Does this blog post exhibit my happiness or convey a message?
2. Will this article be relevant or useful after 10 years?

I mercilessly killed all other drafts which do not pass this evaluation. In 2013, I wrote 25 articles + 10 deleted drafts. Statistically, I got inspired to write on **9% of the days** in this year. If I continue to write consistently, I may be able to publish a 350-page book in 10 years. Does not look good to me! I decided to write more.

### Goals Vs Rituals

With many different challenges that I completed this year, I slowly realized the difference between focusing on goals Vs focusing on the rituals.  

**The focus on goals is very inspiring in the beginning, and when the inspiration drains out over time, it becomes stressful.** Since you have started the goal and communicated it to the world, there is pressure to complete it. I have experienced this in many situations in my life, before 2012.  

**The focus on the rituals is boring in the beginning, and when the habit sets in, it feels like a breeze.** Rituals are the daily routine that you do to accomplish the goals. No matter whether you are inspired or not, you should complete the tasks for the day. I know how much you can accomplish if you stick to your simple rituals. The year 2013 is a testimonial for me.   

Becoming a Writer is one of my big dreams. What do I want to accomplish?  

Write a personal development book? ― Yes.  
Write a fiction novel? ― Yes.  
Write a sci-fiction novel? ― Yes.  
Write a technical book? ― Yes.  
Write more in blogs? ― Yes.  
Change the world with my writings? ― Yes.  

I want to do everything that a writer could do. That's me. When it comes to imagination, I never put a limit on my thoughts/goals (Simply that I am a reality-challenged person)  

But, the only way to accomplish any of those goals is to focus on realistic rituals. Hmm. Let's get real, here.  

### Writing Rituals

I want to keep my rituals simple, and realistic and do not demand a lot of my time & energy. This is very important to keep up with the rituals daily. Below is my new ritual starting today, until the end of 2014.  

> I will write for 15 minutes a day, 4 days a week, until the penultimate week of 2014.  

**No Goals. Only one simple ritual.** Cool. Right?. This ritual roughly translates to 55 hrs of writing. This practice will instill a "dedicated writing habit" in me, which will help me to become a professional writer in the future.  

### Other Questions

**Will I publish a blog post 4 times a week?**  

No. My evaluation criteria still hold good. I will publish only when it is good to publish. Just like when digging a well, the muddy water comes first and then the clean spring water, the first few days or weeks of writing may be completely non-sense / junk, etc (especially on the days without inspiration). I hope I will learn the tricks of the trade to get clearer thoughts on paper on any normal day.  

**Blogging is the only outlet?**  

Most of my writings will find its way to my blog. However, I may choose to write on paper and may reserve some content for a specific book. I will let my writing choose its outlet.  

**Will 15 minutes be enough?**  

The purpose here is not to accomplish any goal, but to develop the habit of writing consistently. 15 minutes in the minimum mandatory time. I will increase the writing time, depending on my inspiration, available time & other tasks on that day, etc.  

**Why now?**  

I recently became a member of the Facebook group "Live Your Legend - Creators Guild", created by Scott Dinsmore. I was inspired by so many people starting to write. Along with that, a few of my Facebook friends and one of my real-life friends "Sruthi Pandarinathan" are writing books (novels, stories, poems, etc) now. All of them are first-time authors. They are going to struggle and travel the same path that I am going to travel. Why not travel together? I hope to get a lot of support and feedback from everyone and I may be able to provide the same to others.
