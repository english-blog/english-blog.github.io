**Translation**: Within 5 mins, you'll bully the new person. You are a Life Coach now, huh?. F***

Comment from my school friend. 

My school friend called me, after a long time. It was an interesting conversation about our school life, friends gangs, bullying as a fun activity, our perpetual victim friends, our current life, etc etc...

Typically on any allegation against me, I'd tear the other person apart with irrelevant facts with a strong authoritative tone. In the end, no one remembers the allegations. That was me, all my life (ask my wife, she'll have endless stories 😉 )

But, 

This time, something has changed. ***I smiled***. I didn't defend myself. I saw what I was and what I am now. I can accept the change. My self-awareness expands with every interaction. It's like a treasure hunt within myself. I am curious to find what I am made of. I am happy about it 😀 

The only difference between the past and present is - a lot of coaching conversations. Trust me, it didn't happen overnight. The changes are small and slow, and with time it could turn around your life. 

Do you want to know you?.
