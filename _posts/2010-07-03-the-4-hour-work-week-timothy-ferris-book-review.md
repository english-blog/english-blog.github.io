"The 4-hour work week - Escape the 9-5, live anywhere and join the new rich." The book, which transformed few of my beliefs, addressed the fears that I had in me, without me knowing that. Tim painted new colors in my dream picture, with his own and I love it.  

This book is constructed into 4 major groups - DEAL - (Definition, Elimination,Automation & Liberation) with multiple chapters. Many chapters end with Q&A. I would suggest you to take time to answer those questions. If you just flip through the pages, without associating your own life, I doubt this book will make any difference, other than leaving you in surprise. The book begins with the definition of the "New Rich" and Tim's real life story.  

In the first group **D - Definition**, the author discusses about the differences between the NR and others, identifying the goals and introduces Dreamline and TMI. "The fat man in the red BMW convertible" - this metaphor made me think a lot. That's what most of the ultra-successful millionaires look like. I do not have the slightest interest to become one of them. The comfort challenges like eye gazing, proposing, getting phone numbers etc are really good. I even suggested them to my friend and he is happy. (I do that already, so did need it)  

The second group **E - Elimination** is what I would suggest everyone to read. Even if you love to work more than 8 hrs a day, these simple tips and techniques will help you to perform better. The 80/20 principle and the Parkinson's law are explained with live examples. Tips on selective ignorance and time management are excellent. For ex. The number of times, you check emails on a busy day and the time you lose with interruption those emails brings is directly proportional. I started checking emails only few times in a day and close "Lotus Notes" (Email client) as soon as I am done with reading emails. You won't believe, it looks very simple, but very productive. The emails which I use to respond immediately were not that urgent, than the things that I was doing.  

The third group **A - Automation**. Introduced a lot of new things. Outsourcing your day to day mundane activities to a virtual assistant is completely new to me and I am gonna hire a VA for me :) The idea of separating income from your time spent is really required for having a mobile lifestyle. Since the author followed the path of the entrepreneur, he discloses all the tips and tricks of marketing, products, affiliations, royalty, licensing etc. But mine is a different ball game related to creativity, so these chapters took a little more time to complete.  

The last group **L - Liberation**. Starts with the tips on how to escape from the office. ha ha ha ah.. no.. not in the way you think. Instead of working for 30 - 45 years and planning for a retirement, the author suggests mini-retirements of three to six months, which is completely practical and will give you a glimpse of how your retirement will feel like. After one mini-retirement, your perception about retirements will definitely change and you are still young to change the decisions ;). He provides the practical tips and step by step instructions for your mini-retirements and a tour around the world.  

The in last few "Restricted Reading" chapters, the author lists down the books, resources that you will need for a vagabonding life. This book packed more information that It could possibly include. It was a very pleasure experience reading a book like this. Try it :)
