When was the last time, I spoke to the rose plants while watering them in the morning?

When was the last time, I read a book aloud in the terrace, while the early morning sunlight rejuvenated my bare body?

When was the last time, I climbed, jumped, hugged, kissed a big tree?

When was the last time, I walked slowly in rain, enjoying the chillness without having to worry about the smart phone?

When was the last time, I spoke to my sisters & friends throughout the night, and went to sleep in the morning?

When was the last time, I held Sangavi's hand and walked leisurely in a park?

When was the last time, we parked our cycles on the road side and chatted with friends for hours?

When was the last time, we simply gathered and played Cricket, Kabadi, Wall-Tennis all weekend, every weekend?

When was the last time, I simply drove without a destination in mind?

When was the last time, we went to beach, enjoyed playing with the waves, without taking a picture?

When was the last time, I went to a library and spent the whole day reading?

When was the last time, I coded throughout the night, without checking the social media even once?

When was the last time, I wrote a poem in tamil, while enjoying the conversation with the moon?

When was the last time, I read the same book again, because it was too good?

When was the last time, I simply enjoyed solitude and stillness in my life?

and many more ...

I lived that life !!!

Now, 

I don't remember my closest school friend's kid's name, but I know my senior manager's dog's name.

I don't remember my cousin's birthday, but I know the birthday of a friend whom I met once in Las Vegas. 

I don't remember how many were in my college gang, but I know 1000+ friends in facebook.

I know. Change is inevitable. Life has Changed.

When I pause and look back at my life, I remember only the events that made me truly happy from inside. Not the money I earned, the house I bought, the cars I drove, the titles I held in office, the friends in facebook or the followers in twitter.

In this finite life, why should I waste my time in doing things which does not matter in the end?.

I am going after those precious little experiences which will make me smile in my death bed. 

I am erasing my presence in the digital world and embracing the real world for every need of mine. 

I am making a big decision to stay small, deliberately.

### Why do I blame facebook for my laziness/addiction?

I never said facebook caused this **void** in my life. Social Media is one of the biggest distraction in my life, at this moment. I am simply eliminating the distractions from my life one by one, starting with social media.

> Focus in nothing more than eliminating distractions

### Why can't I reduce the time spent on Social Media?

I tried. That's easy. 

### Why am I leaving still?

There is an insatiable urge to **share** every little event in my life. When I go to a new place, my first thought is, "Wow. Nice Place. Post the picture in facebook". When I start/do any activity, there is a voice in my head that tells me to share it in facebook immediately. It does not stop with sharing. After I shared something special, I keep looking for the "likes" & "comments" from my friends. The more "likes" I get, the more happier I am. If I don't get likes for something close to my heart, that triggers a confusion in my mind.

Yes. I want to be "liked". Like every other human being. But the cost that I pay in the real world to get "likes" in a virtual world does not match. Restricting the time on Social Network did not help to control the urge.

> I don't like the "need" to be heard by others.

### What would I lose?

**A lot of contacts** - A quick look at my digital presence surprised me. I am in 20+ social networks. It took me close to an hour to delete my data from those websites. Here is snapshot of the major players.

1. Facebook (Friends - 1055, Duration - 5 years, 10 months, 23 days)
2. Twitter (Followers - 808, Duration - 5 years, 2 months, 16 days)
3. Google+ (Followers - 224, Duration - 2 years, 11 months, 16 days)

Losing contacts does not mean losing friends. I am simply severing one of the communication channel.

**Quick turn-around for getting information** - As soon as I post a question or ask for help, I get the answers in my wall or inbox. Thanks to all my friends.

**Intellectual Debates** - Facebook helped me to get into intellectual discussions with my friends on various topics - science, religion, politics, reservations, women rights, relationships etc. I get fresh and diverse perspective on each of the topics. I also came to know more about my friends, their beliefs, their political views etc. Every discussion made me a little more wiser.

**A lot of memories** - Facebook is the repository of all the major events that happened in my life in the past 5+ years. There are times, when I have nothing else to do, I simply go back in my timeline or friends timeline's to look at the memorable events. Thus, spending more time in Social Media. Now, I will download all my personal data from facebook and preserve it locally.

**A platform to showcase my creation** - I made a lot of friends and followers in social media, over the years. My friends are my best critics, who helped me to groom my writing over the years. Thanks to all my friends for all the constructive feedback.

### What will I gain?

1. Little more quality time with friends and family. 
2. Complete freedom from one of the distractions. 
3. Protection of my privacy (Actually, I don't really care about it)

### Will I be completely out of the digital world?

No. I love writing. I will continue to blog at the below websites. You can subscribe to these blogs, if you find them useful.

1. [{{site.title}}]({{site.url}})
2. [&#2965;&#2985;&#2997;&#3009;](http://tamil.smileprem.com)
3. [Raw Vegan Recipes](http://raw-vegan-recipes.blogspot.com/)

I will also retain my [LinkedIn]({{site.linkedin}}) account for my professional growth.

### What happens to the facebook pages?

I have the below three pages - for the above three blogs. I will hand over the admin responsibility to someone else in those respective groups.

1. Smile
2. &#2965;&#2985;&#2997;&#3009;
3. Raw Vegan Recipes

### What happens to the facebook groups?

I don't know. I treasure the association with the below groups. I need to talk to the admin and establish other means to get only the most important information from the group. Lets see how that unfolds for me.

1. [Live Your Legend](https://www.facebook.com/groups/LYLcreatorsguild/)
2. [Bangalore Runners](https://www.facebook.com/groups/233302930081964/)

### When will I erase my digital presence?

I am planning to delete all my social media accounts by June 16th 2014, 23:00 to 23:59 IST. This time is needed to backup the data, handover the admin responsibilities, establishing alternate login methods for the websites with facebook/google login, allowing friends to download any of their tagged pictures etc,.

### Will I come back to the digital world?

I don't know. May be. But, not until the end of the year 2014.

### How can I be contacted?

I will be available via the contact form in this website. If you know me personally, you would already have my mobile number. Just call me :)
