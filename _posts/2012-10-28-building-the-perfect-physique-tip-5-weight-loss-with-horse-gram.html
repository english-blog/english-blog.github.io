There is a very old saying/proverb in Tamil "இளைத்தவனுக்கு எள்ளு, கொழுத்தவனுக்கு கொள்ளு" which means "Feed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_seed" target="_blank">Sesame seed</a> to a skinny person,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_gram" target="_blank">Horse gram</a> to an obese person".<br />
<br />
Horse gram is called Kollu (கொள்ளு) in Tamil. This use to be one of the regular ingredients in South Indian food for so many centuries; fading away slowly for pizzas and burgers. This is mainly fed as fodder to horses for it's nutritional values. Horses and us eat the same food?. I don't mind. Since, most men secretly desire to have few "features" of horses. he he he :) Jokes apart, I am surprised at the medicinal aspects of Horse gram and regretted that I never ate Kollu in my life. I wish I had. Here are they;<br />
<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Excellent Natural Fat Burner</li>
<li>Lowering&nbsp;Cholesterol&nbsp;levels</li>
<li>Regulates blood pressure and blood glucose levels</li>
<li>Horse gram powder mixed water helps in controlling boils and skin rashes</li>
<li>The water that was used in boiling horse gram helps in regulating fever</li>
<li>Helps to dissolve kidney stones and expel them through the urethra</li>
<li>Helps to cure Rheumatism</li>
<li>Regulating and purifying&nbsp;Mensuration</li>
<li>Controlling post-delivery bleeding (Pregnant&nbsp;Women must avoid this)</li>
<li>Reduces pain in dry piles</li>
<li>Reduces flatulence</li>
<li>... the list goes on...</li>
</ul>
<br />
Horse gram can be used in variety of South&nbsp;Indian&nbsp;dishes as a regular dhal or mixed with regular dhals. I included the&nbsp;recipes&nbsp;in this blog to help you prepare them. Alternatively, you can use them as sprouts or as powder.<br />
<br />
I am going to drink a glass of water mixed with two teaspoons of horse gram powder in empty stomach every morning.&nbsp;As usual, I will post an update to the effects of eating Kollu (Horse gram) in my next post.<br />
<br />
<b>Warning:</b> Excessive consumption may increase the body heat. If you are planning to start this diet,&nbsp;Please consult with your physician for your medical condition before&nbsp;starting&nbsp;this diet.&nbsp;I would suggest two times a week. You can increase gradually as you get yourself comfortable with this diet.<br />

<b>Update from previous tips:</b><br />
<br />
So far, we were trying to make simple lifestyle changes to maintain the ideal weight for as long as we live. I don't prefer to lose the weight quick and gain it back. With the previous tips, I was able to lose 1.5 kg in the beginning and I hit a plateau. My weight fluctuates on a daily basis, but I average around the same weight range. The weight does not seem to shed off automatically.&nbsp;So, I am going to change my diet a little bit with this. Let's see what happens.<br />

An interesting observation from the chart is that I gain weight the second day after I had party/ate too much food. Very little data to establish this as a pattern, but interesting.&nbsp;If you are new to this blog, you may want to read the other tips ...<br />
