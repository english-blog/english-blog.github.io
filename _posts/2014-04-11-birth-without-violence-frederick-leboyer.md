**Book:** Birth Without Violence  
**Author:** Frederick Leboyer M.D.  
**ISBN-13:** 978-0892819836

Should the childbirth be a painful experience for both the mother and the child?.  

Should the childbirth happen in a place filled with bright light, noise, and people?.  

Should the child cry out loud as soon as they are born?.  

Should the umbilical cord be cut immediately?.  

Should the child be separated from the mother, cleaned and weighed immediately?.  

What if everything that we know about childbirth is wrong?.  

If children are angels, shouldn't their entry into this world, be a fairy tale?.  

Frederick Leboyer, who has himself delivered more than 10,000 babies, shows us that childbirth does not have to be a terrifying experience. Before I say a word, please look at the below comparison.

Can you sense the difference?.  

We were taught by the society, our parents, our grandparents for generations that childbirth has to happen in a certain way. Even bible says so. Why should we think otherwise?.  

The man who delivered thousands of babies in a regular way felt that this process could be improved. He made small, simple changes to the childbirth process and helped 1000+ babies to transition to the world from their mother's womb in a pleasant, enjoyable way. All you need is a lot of patience, compassion, love for the baby and let nature do its job in its own time. No need to rush and interfere.  

### Birth without violence

Some of the small changes he did were

1. No bright lights. Use the bare minimum amount of light required. Usually a night bulb. 
2. No noise. No talks. No shouting. If there is a need to talk, they just whisper.
3. Patience. A lot of patience. It's going to be longer than the regular process.
4. Do not cut the umbilical cord immediately. During the childbirth, the baby pushes a lot of oxygenated blood to the placenta, so that the baby shrinks and can come out easily. The placenta beats for few minutes (pumps the blood back to the baby) after the child is born. While the baby tries to get into the rhythm of breathing, the blood from placenta supplies the required oxygen to the baby's little brain. The umbilical cord can be cut after it stops beating. In some cultures, the placenta is called "The Little Mother" and they don't cut it at all.  
5. Place the baby in the mother's belly and let the mother connect with the baby with a soft touch. The baby realizes the mother's touch, feels comfortable and slowly the breathing becomes normal.  
6. Separate the baby from the mother and keep the baby in a tub filled with warm water. The baby floats. Every little muscle in its body relaxes. The baby opens its eyes, moves its hand's legs and enjoys the stay in the water.  

... and many more tips on how to handle the baby during the entire process. 

The whole book reads like a poem. Mesmerizing. I couldn't close the book. When you are done with reading, you are sure to have a smile on your face. If you are planning a baby or not, please read this book. This is one of the few books that changed the world permanently. Look at the 12 hrs old baby who was born in a natural way.

I and my wife are glad that we got to know this before our first child. We are definitely going to make our child's entry into this world a very pleasant one. I am very much thankful for Frederick Leboyer for writing this book. I thank my friends Reba and Paul for successfully deliver a cute baby girl in the most natural way possible and all the information and encouragement that we received from them regarding childbirth.  

This book is a must-read for all :)
