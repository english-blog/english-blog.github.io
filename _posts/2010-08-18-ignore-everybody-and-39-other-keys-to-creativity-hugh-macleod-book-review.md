Hugh Macleod is a copywriter, cartoonist, avid blogger, writer (this is his first book), CEO of Stormhoek USA, which markets South African wine in the States. I thought that this book is all about creativity. Guess, I was wrong. This book doesn't tell you, how to become creative, instead it guides you, if you are already creative, have some good ideas and don't know how to proceed with your ideas.  
  
Hugh developed the habit of drawing in the back of the business cards with cartoons and sarcastically humorous content, while he was waiting for his date, in the NYC bars. He started a blog gapingvoid.com and started publishing these business card cartoons. He has opinion on everything that you can think about. This book is nothing but selected 39 blogs from his website. You can read all of them in his website.  
  
When you have an idea or a business plan or an art form, which is completely unique and different from the rest of the world's thinking, this is THE BOOK that you may need to read. The author guides you step by step, explains you the probable mental states that you may have to go through and the probable people that you may have to work with. He uses a lot of real-life examples to explain. This is basically a guide for you, to protect your creativity and still enjoy it.  
  
All these blogs are based on his experience (bitter/good) in NYC as a copywriter and by observing his colleagues and friends etc. Most of the blogs are funny and good. I couldn't agree with some of them.  
  
Few of my favorite blogs/chapters from this book are :  
  
**Ignore everybody** - not in the real physical sense. Just that, great ideas alter the power balance relationship and are always initially resisted. So, if you really think that your idea is worth pursuing, just ignore everybody (including your loved ones)  
  
**Everyone is born creative** - Everybody is given a box of crayons in the Kindergarten. But as we grew, the crayons were replaced with possibly un-inspiring algebra, history, politics etc (** Many people love these subjects). Every now and then, you may hear a wee voice inside your head "I want my crayon please". But we are too busy with our mundane task, that we don't listen. Just listen!!!.  
  
**Everybody has their own private Mount Everest they were put on this earth to climb.**  
  
**Dont worry about finding inspiration. It comes eventually.**  
  
**Power is never given. Power is taken.**  
  
I wont suggest that this is a must-read. But its worth casual read on the weekends. Who knows, you may pickup your crayons, after this book. Just try it !!!
