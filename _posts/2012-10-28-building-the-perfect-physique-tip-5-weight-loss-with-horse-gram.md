There is a very old saying/proverb in Tamil "இளைத்தவனுக்கு எள்ளு, கொழுத்தவனுக்கு கொள்ளு" which means "Feed [Sesame seed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_seed) to a skinny person, [Horse gram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_gram) to an obese person".  
  
Horse gram is called Kollu (கொள்ளு) in Tamil. This use to be one of the regular ingredients in South Indian food for so many centuries; fading away slowly for pizzas and burgers. This is mainly fed as fodder to horses for it's nutritional values. Horses and us eat the same food?. I don't mind. Since, most men secretly desire to have few "features" of horses. he he he :) Jokes apart, I am surprised at the medicinal aspects of Horse gram and regretted that I never ate Kollu in my life. I wish I had. Here are they;  
  
* Excellent Natural Fat Burner  
* Lowering Cholesterol levels  
* Regulates blood pressure and blood glucose levels  
* Horse gram powder mixed water helps in controlling boils and skin rashes  
* The water that was used in boiling horse gram helps in regulating fever  
* Helps to dissolve kidney stones and expel them through the urethra  
* Helps to cure Rheumatism  
* Regulating and purifying Mensuration  
* Controlling post-delivery bleeding (Pregnant Women must avoid this)  
* Reduces pain in dry piles  
* Reduces flatulence  
* ... the list goes on...  
  
Horse gram can be used in variety of South Indian dishes as a regular dhal or mixed with regular dhal. I included the recipes in this blog to help you prepare them. Alternatively, you can use them as sprouts or as powder.  
  
I am going to drink a glass of water mixed with two teaspoons of horse gram powder in empty stomach every morning. As usual, I will post an update to the effects of eating Kollu (Horse gram) in my next post.  
  
**Warning:** Excessive consumption may increase the body heat. If you are planning to start this diet, Please consult with your physician for your medical condition before starting this diet. I would suggest two times a week. You can increase gradually as you get yourself comfortable with this diet.

**Update from previous tips:**  
  
So far, we were trying to make simple lifestyle changes to maintain the ideal weight for as long as we live. I don't prefer to lose the weight quick and gain it back. With the previous tips, I was able to lose 1.5 kg in the beginning and I hit a plateau. My weight fluctuates on a daily basis, but I average around the same weight range. The weight does not seem to shed off automatically. So, I am going to change my diet a little bit with this. Let's see what happens.

An interesting observation from the chart is that I gain weight the second day after I had party/ate too much food. Very little data to establish this as a pattern, but interesting. If you are new to this blog, you may want to read the other tips ...
