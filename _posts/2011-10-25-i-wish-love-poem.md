![Love Poem]({{site.img-url}}/man-woman-love-poem-riverside-sunset.jpg)  
  

I wish I could hold time  
And be here forever  
As long as the stars live  
But all I have is tonight  


Take me in your arms  
Hold me for very last time  
Like you could never let go  
For all I have is tonight  


Let's try and fool the time  
And live this night forever  
Like there is no tomorrow  
Beyond the confines of tonight  


Don't look at the clock  
For the time's ticking away  
To tear me away from you  
For all we have is tonight  


Take my life in return  
But give me your love  
To stay buried in my heart  
Even after long tonight  


And I shall never be alone  
Till death do us apart  
If only you give me your love  
And never take back this night  


When the morning creeps up  
And wrenches you from me  
I'll go back to sleep  
And pretend its still tonight  


Down the lanes of future  
I'll smile though my tears  
When I look back at you  
And embrace the memories of tonight  

-By My Good Friend
