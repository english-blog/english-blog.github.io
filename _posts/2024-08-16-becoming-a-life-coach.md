It was a really confusing period of my life. Everything was going well and nothing was going well at the same time. From other's perspective, I had a successful career, wealthy life, good health, happy family etc etc... There was nothing anyone could complain about in my life. But deep inside, there was a void. There was a question,

> "How many times am I going to repeat my yesterday?"

The answer wasn't very fulfilling. At the same time, I have no idea of what I am looking for... I reached out to a friend, mentor coach Arvind Ramasundaram for help. He spoke to me for a while and suggested me to become a life coach.

"Life Coach?... Me?..." I was laughing hard. But many months of training and coaching 50+ people, here I am, a Life Coach...

Have I found my true calling?... Hell no... I am still searching, but this time with an awareness of who I am and what I can do... Yes. I coach and get coached regularly.

Every coaching session peels a layer of doubt, uncertainty and bring you closer to the complete awareness about yourself...

In software engineering terms, your life is a recursive function with no exit condition. You will figure out the exit condition in one of the iterations, but you wouldn't know which one. How exciting and adventurous your life would be, if you understand this?.

Are you lost?.
