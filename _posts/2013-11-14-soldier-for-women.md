By the end of January 2013, Gillete started a campaign "Soldier for Women". Its a TV ad where the men & women from different strata of the society come together, with the men standing by the women as "Soldiers" - pledged to support them, protect them & stand by them. This ad created a lot of controversies among women activists. Many women felt that this campaign is insulting them. However this campaign slowly caught up & many celebrities like Mandhira Bedi were taking the pledge and spreading the word.

To support this campaign, [blogadda](http://www.blogadda.com) launched a blog contest [Soldier for Women](http://blog.blogadda.com/2013/03/21/soldier-for-women-campaign-indian-bloggers), asking the women blogger to blog about the men in their lives who stood up for women in any occasion. One of my friend Sruthi Pandarinathan wrote a blog post about me. Check the blog [The Intellectual Soldier](http://penurheart.blogspot.in/2013/04/the-intellectual-soldier.html). I did not expect that. I was surprised to see that women see me as a Soldier as well (even though I never fought a physical fight :). The surprise quadrupled this weekend, when Sruthi gave me this T-Shirt. BlogAdda sent her this T-Shirt for the blog that she wrote.

I have nothing more to say other than these words, "I am honored. Thank you!"

I leave the answer to the reader's perspective.
