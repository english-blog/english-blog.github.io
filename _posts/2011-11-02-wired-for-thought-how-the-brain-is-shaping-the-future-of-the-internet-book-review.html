Jeffrey Stibel is a brain scientist and entrepreneur, who is the chairman of <a href="http://www.braingate.com/" target="_blank">BrainGate</a>, a brain-implant company that allows people to use their thoughts to control electrical devices and also the president of <a href="http://www.web.com/" target="_blank">web.com</a>&nbsp;which helps&nbsp;entrepreneurs&nbsp;to grow their business in the web. Most importantly, this book is recommended by my all time&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;author <a href="http://www.johnassaraf.com/" target="_blank">John Assaraf</a>. What else you need to read this book?.<br />
<br />
Stibel says that "The Internet is a brain". This is because the Internet (unlike computers) has&nbsp;evolved&nbsp;with many of the basic structures and abilities of the brain. He compares the evolution of human brains over the millions of years with the evolution of the network of computers (i.e. Internet) and concludes that both follow the same pattern. He claims that the network of neurons in our brain is similar to the network of computers in Internet. He doesn't claim that the Internet may become "conscious" in human sense in future. But, it will be capable of creating a collective consciousness.<br />
<br />
This book is divided into four sections with multiple chapters.<br />
<br />
<b>Part I - Building the Brain:</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From a scientist perspective, he explains the human brain's thinking capability and its limitations. Three most important things to the brain: information storage, processing and communication with other neurons. As of now, the Internet does information storage and communication. Cloud computing does the processing. &nbsp;What would happen, if we upgrade the Internet with Cloud computing?. We can&nbsp;achieve&nbsp;what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce" target="_blank">MapReduce</a> did for google.<br />
<br />
<b>Part II - Internet Intelligence:</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The human brain does not calculate all the possible combinations of output for making a decision. It makes decision with little information (Instinct?). Its very good at predicting where the cricket ball will land after a sixer without knowing its velocity, trajectory path etc, rather than predicting the weather next day. To process very little information, you don't need supercomputers. You get the idea?. Also, he talks about "Creative Destruction" in a separate chapter. How neurons lose the connections after maturing into a complete brain is analogous to the way many websites/companies disappear from the web.<br />
<br />
<b>Part III - The Brain behind the Web:</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He compares the websites to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme" target="_blank">memes</a>. In a chapter, he discusses how the search engines work (primarily google) and the competition between the websites to appear on the first page of the search results is analogous to the Survival of the fittest - Darwinism. He is one of the man behind the algorithm that propels Google's Adsense. He discusses the importance of understanding the language to select the right ads based on the keywords. Very Interesting!.<br />
<br />
Metcalfe's law is discussed in detail and why it did not work. He defines the stages of the Networking as<br />
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li><b>The Big Bang</b> - The Internet, ant colonies and the brain, all have periods of rapid expansion. Stunting its growth is dangerous at this time.</li>
<li><b>The Collapse</b> - When the network become too big, either it will implode (the brain loses half of its neurons) or its growth will slow rapidly (as with ant colonies). You should allow the network to stabilize.</li>
<li><b>The Equilibrium</b> - Its the stage, where the network oscillates roughly around a certain size. The network is at its peak performance. (like a matured brain)</li>
</ol>
Further, he discusses in detail about the Social Networks and the advantages "facebook" has over the other similar sites. Very interesting to see where the web is going !.<br />
<br />
<b>Part IV - I, Internet:</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is the very interesting section of the entire book, which discusses where the Internet is heading to?. Some of the predictions are...<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Internet algorithms will mature and start discarding/penalizing links that are irrelevant, unnatural or fake. (W3C or ICANN?)</li>
<li>Websites will pull information from various sites to create collages of new information, dynamically (a semantic web).</li>
<li>The hyperlinks will evolve to incorporate dynamic weighting based on how many people click or how relevant the link is. (think as a color code, red - best, blue - Good, yellow - OK etc)</li>
<li>The Internet will be able to modify and create Web Sites.</li>
<li>The search engines will evolve into dynamic portals - search for anything and you will be presented with a dynamically created page from contents all over the world. You don't need to go to the specific websites.</li>
<li>Virtual Reality will become an extension of real life or in some cases a replacement. Check out <a href="http://www.habbo.com/" target="_blank">Habbo</a>&nbsp;or <a href="http://secondlife.com/" target="_blank">SecondLife</a>&nbsp;websites. Already millions of people are in virtual worlds spending real money (millions of $$$).</li>
</ul>
When I first started reading this book, I thought Stibel is going to present the SEO concepts in Brain flavour. But, I was wrong. I have a completely new perspective of the Internet. With this information and perspective, we can fine-tune our websites for long time survival in the Web. Many of these things are already happening. Let's jump in and have fun. Thanks to Stibel for a wonderful book.<br />
