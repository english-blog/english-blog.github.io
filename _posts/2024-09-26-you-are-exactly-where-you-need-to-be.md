Let's go back to 6th Aug 1945, 8 AM in Hiroshima or Nagasaki. Let's tell everyone, "You are exactly where you need to be".

What?. Ok, Ok. 

Don't want to travel back in time?

Let's go to Palestine, Israel, Ukraine, or Russia and tell the young men, women, and children who are being tortured and killed for reasons beyond their control, "You are exactly where you need to be"

Or go to the victims of violence, and abuse (fill in with any atrocity that you could think of), a few moments before the violence and tell them, directly looking into their eyes, "You are exactly where you need to be"

Unless you are a narcissistic psychopath, no sane human being would say such mean words.

You could blame me for being negative. 

Why not tell the quote to American President Donald J. Trump, on the recent assassination attempts. He would be convinced that he was exactly where he needed to be.

Yeah, you're right. But you won't tell that same quote to John F. Kennedy, would you?

> Depending on the context, the powerful positive quote would be considered the most negative quote.

I clearly see there is a boundary for this quote to be considered positive. What are those boundaries could be?. I am imagining,

You should have a loss. (not too drastic, not too small, kinda Goldilocks zone)
You should mourn/grieve the situation and need someone to console you.
You should have the skills and ability to escape the situation by yourself.
The most important condition - This can be validated only by looking backward. (only on few cases).

Let's say a victim of violent gang rape, become a visionary and works to improve the safety of women across the world. She even receives a Nobel Prize. Do you think, she was exactly where she needed to be, being gang raped by monsters? I don't think so.

This doesn't work in all the situations and not in all the times. But the quote says, "EXACTLY". As if they know the whole journey of your life. How absurd?.

Trust me, whoever says this to you has, no clue of where they are, or where they are going and they have blind faith that something good will happen. They expect you to have blind faith too. 

Any blind faith without reason = Superstition.

Why is this quote so popular? I think,

> The whole problem with the world is that fools and fanatics are always so certain of themselves, and wiser people so full of doubts. - By someone, I don't know

When someone said this to me, it eased my pain. What else I should do? 

Say, no to Toxic Positivity.

> If you are in a situation that you don't like. Get the fuck out of it or die trying. Period.

Man, Think and Act. That's all there is to life.
