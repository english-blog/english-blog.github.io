I hate carrying multiple credit cards in my wallet. We must get rid of this plastic cards and move on to the future. The magnetic strips in the credit cards basically identify you & tells the merchant if you have enough credit to purchase any product. The merchant gets the information from the credit card issuer via a phone line.  

Think about this... We don't need any external items to uniquely identify us... right? Each and everyone of us has unique features like finger-prints or retina. Why cant we use them?...  

Retina scan is one of the oldest & most secure bio-metrics available today. The blood vessels on the back of everyone's eye has unique pattern. The retina scan uses a light source to illuminate the blood vessels which are then photographed and analyzed. They use something called coupler to analyze the pattern.  

Its impossible to fake a human retina at this moment. I read somewhere that the error rate of retinal scan is one in ten million where as for fingerprint, its one in 500.  

OK.. let me come to the point... I want to have a centralized database of retinal scan data of registered users.. Instead of carrying a credit card & swiping it... I would stare at the retinal scan for a moment.. that's it I am done... the merchant can ask for signature...  

There must be touch screen in front of me & if I have multiple cards, it should get the details of all the credit cards/debit cards from the centralized database & show the list of them... then I can choose any one credit / debit card.  

At this moment retinal scan is very slow. But that's not an excuse. That's a limitation that we need to break... I strongly believe that in future, retinal scans can be faster than the barcode scanner....  

This is not just for financial purposes.. we can use the database to map his SSN, Driving license, credit history, criminal background etc... and anything that you could think of....  

Imagine that you violate the traffic law for some reason.. the cop need not even ask you any question... just scan your retina, he has all the information in his fingertip... haan.. this is not good for me.. I didn't think this when I started typing this blog ;(  

Who the hell in the world needs retina scan... I prefer to carry credit cards ;)  

Old is gold ;)
