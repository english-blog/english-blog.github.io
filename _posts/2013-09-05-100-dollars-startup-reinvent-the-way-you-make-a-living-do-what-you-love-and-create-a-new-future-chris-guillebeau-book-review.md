We have read business books which talks about starting a business from scratch, may be a step by step advice on what to do and what not to do. Also, we have seen books with the collection of inspiring stories (Ex. [I have A Dream]({{site.url}}/i-have-a-dream-rashmi-bansal-book-review/), [Connect The Dots]({{site.url}}/connect-the-dots-rashmi-bansal-book-review/)) of the successful entrepreneur who created the business out of nothing. There are numerous books which just have the collection of tips, quotes, fiction (Ex. [Trump - The Way To The Top]({{site.url}}/trump-the-way-to-the-top-the-best-business-advice-i-ever-received-donald-trump-book-review/), [Ignore Everybody]({{site.url}}/ignore-everybody-and-39-other-keys-to-creativity-hugh-macleod-book-review/), [The Leader Who Had No Title]({{site.url}}/the-leader-who-had-no-title-robin-sharma-book-review/)) etc.,  

This book is different from the other categories. This book is a step-by-step practical guide for anyone with an idea or simply a passion, to create a successful business. Also, the success stories of the successful entrepreneurs are sprinkled all over the book in appropriate places. When you read a topic / idea / plan from this book, there is a corresponding real life success story in the next few pages. The author Chris Guillebeau did collect extensive amount of data and crammed them into this $100 Start up book in a easy fun to read way. He shows that transforming an idea into a successful business is much easier than ever before. He shows us how to test the idea with minimum amount of money before jumping straight into the business. He proves that the money we have is enough and there are no excuses left to start.  
  
Though there are thousands of thriving successful businesses around the world, for this book Chris considers the businesses that were started with a capital of $100 or less and making a profit of at least $50,000 per year. So, we are not reading about the big corporations, but about the everyday people who identified the opportunity and used it to their success. Some entrepreneurs started the business out of curiosity, some started because they hate or did not like the job they were in and some others were forced to start, because they were fired from the job. Whatever the case may be, they are running successful businesses right now across the world.  
  
Who is this guy Chris Guillebeau?. Seriously I could not pronounce his last name. He is an entrepreneur, traveler and writer. He never had a job and built multiple businesses. He traveled to 175 countries so far (that's 89% countries in this world - Total 196) before the age of 35. He is the author of a best seller book "The Art of Non-Conformity". This guy knows what he talks about in this book.
  
Even if you are not looking to start a business, reading this book may inspire you to do so.You may be surprised at what you can do with the a simple idea or a passion - which you never thought could make you money. I would prefer to keep this book in my reference section and refer to it as and when I need some help. Read it and let me know.
