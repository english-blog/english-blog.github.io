> When you are the fastest, you don't need rear view mirrors.  

Murali told me this sentence during our ECR trip to IG Resorts. He mentioned this sentence with respect to bike driving in heavy traffic in Chennai roads. This provoked a lot of thoughts in me. Even after three days, I am thinking about this sentence.  

This applies to our day to day life also. Only when you fear that some one else might be speeding than you, you look at the rear view mirror, instead of the road ahead for you !!!  

Imagine, that you are in an empty race track or a infinite vast land, driving your favorite power machine... with no roads, no traffic, no other distractions.. Would you look back?. NO !!!... You would be enjoying each and every second of your drive. No fears. No set backs. Only moving forward.  

That's how our life should be. Our life is not about competing with others. No one competes with you unless you think so. We have more than enough of resources, wealth, choices & opportunities for everyone. We should let our creativity juice to enrich this world.  

When we clearly understand that there is no competition for us, we can ONLY move forward !!!. We can choose our own road and travel as fast as we love to :)  

Let me know your thoughts !!!
