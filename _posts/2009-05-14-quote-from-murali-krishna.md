> When you are the fastest, you don't need rear view mirrors. - **Murali**

Murali said that, about bike driving in Chennai roads, on our trip to IG Resorts en route ECR. This provoked a lot of thoughts in me. Even after three days, I am thinking about this sentence.

This applies to our day to day life also. When you fear that someone else might be faster than you, you look in the rearview mirror, instead of the road ahead for you !!!

Imagine that you are on an empty race track or an infinite landscape. You are driving your favorite power machine, with no roads, no traffic, no other distractions. Would you look back?. NO !!!. You would be enjoying each second of your drive. No fears. No setbacks. 

That's how our life should be. Our experience is not about competing with others. No one competes with you unless you think so. We have more than enough of resources, wealth, choices and opportunities for everyone. We should let our creativity juice to enrich this world.

When we understand that there is no competition for us, we can move forward !!!. We can choose our own road and travel as fast as we love to :)
