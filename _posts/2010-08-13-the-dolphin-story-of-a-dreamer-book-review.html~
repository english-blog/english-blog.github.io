The Dolphin, I saw this book in TCS library. #1 International Best Seller. More than 10 Million Copies sold world wide!!!. I became curious. What made this book to sell 10M copies???...<br />
<br />
Its a story about a young dolphin, Daniel Alexander Dolphin - who has a dream. A dream to ride the perfect wave in the sea. As soon as I read the first few pages, I couldn't help myself - not to think about "Jonathan Livingston Seagull". I felt that this dolphin is the same story told with a different character.<br />
<br />
I did a small comparison between both the books. Please remember "Jonathan Livingston Seagull" was published in 1970 and "The Dolphin" in 1996.<br />
<br />
JLS: Hero is a seagull<br />
TD: Hero is a dolphin<br />
<br />
JLS: Seagull has a dream to master the art of flying and break the rules of the flock.<br />
TD: Dolphin has a dream to master the art of surfing and ride the perfect wave and break the rules of the pod.<br />
<br />
JLS: Seagull leaves the flock and ventured into the unknown distances over the ocean.<br />
TD: Dolphin leaves the pod and travels across the vast ocean with no direction.<br />
<br />
JLS: Seagull meets a lot of birds enroute and gets wisdom and directions.<br />
TD: Dolphin meets a lot of fishes enroute and gets wisdom and directions.<br />
<br />
JLS: Seagull fulfills his dream, comes to the flock and enlightens others<br />
TD: Dolphin fulfills his dream, comes to the pod and enlightens others<br />
<br />
JLS: Seagull disappears into heaven in the end.<br />
TD: Dolphin disappears miraculously in the end.<br />
<br />
Both the books has a lot of inspirational quotes scattered across story and implies the same idea - "Follow your dream, no matter what"<br />
<br />
In the book, "The Dolphin" I could also sense the impact of "The Alchemist" which was published couple of decades before this book. If you have not read the other two books, I strongly recommend you to read this book. This would inspire you to follow your dreams. But, if you have already read the other book, this is just redundant information. It would be a funny idea to read both the books one after another.<br />
<br />
Sergio - Don't mistake me. This could be your authentic idea. But it was published already. I know you have written few other books. I will give my real feedback after those books ;)<br />
<br />
I have read the reviews for this book, many people found this very spiritual and inspiring. Why don't you guys try it?.<br />
