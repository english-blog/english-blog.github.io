The previous book that I read, [Attract Money Now]({{site.url}}/attract-money-now-audio-joe-vitale-book-review/) lead me to this extra-ordinary book "Zero Limits". I must say that I am impressed with the "Ho'oponopono"concepts discussed in this book. This is something that I never heard of before. Ho'oponopono is an modern version of an ancient Hawaiian healing system. This modern version is called *Self I-Dentity through Ho'oponopono* (SITH). I am still trying to grasp the idea even hours after reading this book.  
  
The co-author Ihaleakala Hew Len, worked as a psychiatrist in a highly secured ward dedicated for mentally ill criminals in Hawaii State Hospital. Every criminal is chained and placed in separate rooms. There was high level of violence between the criminals and the doctors. Many hospital staff and doctors called in sick - most of them never want to work in that section. However, Dr. Hew Len cured every one of the patients without ever seeing them !!!. Yes. He never met any patient in person. Hard to believe that right?. Yes. For me too. Dr. Hew Len explains that he used Ho'oponopono method to cure the patients.  
  
### What is Ho'oponopono method?  

Before understanding Ho'oponopono method, you must be clear with two things. *Responsibility & Reality.*  
  
**Responsibility**- How would you define it?. You are responsible for what you think, say and do. You take complete ownership of the situations & problems you get into because of your actions. Also, you take pride in achieving your goals due to your persistent actions. Perfect. That's how I would also define responsibility. Are you responsible for your colleague losing her job due to layoff?. Are you responsible for the Sep 11 tragedy?. Are you responsible for the war & killings in Iraq?. Will you be responsible for the War on Syria that Obama is planning?. The answer would be NO. But, Dr. Hew Len says "Yes".  
  
**Reality** - Dr. Hew Len says, "What you see outside (the real world) is nothing but the projection of your inside". When you take 100% responsibility, you are responsible for every single experience that happens in your life. You are collectively responsible for the killing in war zone or the rape of a child in the remote corner of the world. When you hear, see or experience something in your life, be it good or bad - you are co-creating the reality with the others, even though you did not consciously contribute to that specific event or experience. A part of your mind is responsible for that.  
  
Imagine this, you walk in the "Las Vegas Strip", enjoying the casinos and having fun with your friends. Suddenly, out of nowhere an insane homeless guy shouts at you and even tries to attack you - you too are responsible for that event. A part of you was not right and it was in sync with the part of the homeless guy - thus creating an experience for both of you.  
  
### Ho'oponopono Method  

This method is based on love and forgiveness. When something happens to you and it does not feel right for you, you can clean that part of you with love and forgiveness. When the cleansing is complete the experience reverses. You will be surrounded by peace. It is done by simply saying these four sentences in your mind or out loud, when you rehearse the experience in your mind or when that event is happening.  
  
I Love You.  
I am Sorry.  
Please Forgive Me.  
Thank You.  
  
That's it?. Yes. That's it. It is so simple but very powerful. This is the same process used by Dr. Hew Len to cure a ward of criminally insane people, without even seeing them. He will read the report about the patient and use this process to clean the part of him, which in turn cured the patient. You can apply this technique to anything and everything in your life. If you read about a sad event or tragedy happened on the other side of the world, you are responsible too. So, clean it. You can apply this method to yourself, your problems, physical pain, diseases or anything that does not seem normal and happy. There is no limit. This method is about freedom, complete freedom from the past experiences and going to the Zero State of being nothing with no experience at all.   
  
This book is filled with a whole bunch of stories and experiences of the those who practice Ho'oponopono. There are discussions about memory, inspiration, conscious mind, subconscious mind, super conscious mind ,divinity etc. As usual with Dr. Joe's hypnotic writing, you will read the book faster than you think you can. I'm serious. Read it to believe it.  

I already started using Ho'oponopono method and felt peace in mind, the very first day. I am planning to combine Ho'oponopono with [EFT]({{site.url}}/the-eft-manual-cary-craig-book-review/) and add it to my morning rituals. Let's see how it transforms my life.  
  
To learn more about the Ho'oponopono method, I suggest to look for the workshop conducted by Dr. Hew Len in Hawaii, US, Europe etc. Check the reference at the end of this blog. Another item to my Bucket List - *Attend Ho'oponopono workshop in Hawaii with Dr. Hew Len.*  
  
Thank you Dr. Ihaleakala Hew Len for the Ho'oponopono method and Thank you Dr. Joe Vitale for bringing this as a book to the world.
