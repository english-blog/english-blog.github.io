Mar 1st, 2021. ~11.30 PM PST.

We were watching a Tamil movie [Kaaka Muttai](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3973410/) tonight. My wife was sitting next to me, and my 5-year-old daughter in my lap, leaning on my chest, all feeling cozy inside a velvet comforter. Our typical family movie time.

The grandmother character dies in that movie, triggering a conversation between me and my 5-year-old daughter.

**Aradhana (daughter):** Why did she die? (curious)  
**Premkumar (dad):** Everyone dies when they get old. (casual)  
**Aradhana (daughter):** You are old. You'll die soon. (mischief)  
**Premkumar (dad):** Yeah. Maybe. (casual)  

She thinks deeply for a few moments and suddenly sadness engulfs her pretty face. She turned toward me and asked,

**Aradhana (daughter):** Will you have more time with me? (crying)  
**Premkumar (dad):** ...   

I didn't know what to say. My world froze. Trembling words and tearful eyes. Am I happy or sad or confused? Or all of them together?. I don't know. With mixed emotions, I said,

**Premkumar (dad):** Ara, I promise I'll be there for you, as long as I am alive. I love you.

I hugged her tightly for a while, caressing her hair, kissing her head, feeling heavenly to have found the meaning of my existence. 

Moments later, she slept in my arms, peacefully. 

I could not sleep. I'm wide awake. I want to register this moment, hence this blog.

I had the whole of 2020, almost exclusively with my family, inside the house. But...

**Aradhana (daughter):** Will you drop me at school, please?  
**Premkumar (dad):** Sorry Ara, Appa doesn't have time.   

**Aradhana (daughter):** Shall we go for a walk?  
**Premkumar (dad):** Sorry Ara, Appa is busy.  

**Aradhana (daughter):** Will you play with me for 5 minutes, please?  
**Premkumar (dad):** Sorry Ara, Appa has to work.  

**Aradhana (daughter):** I made your favorite place ready. Do you want to see your surprise?.  
(She arranges her favorite toys in the steps to lure me to play with her)  
**Premkumar (dad):** Sorry Ara, Appa has a call.  

**Aradhana (daughter):** Shall we cook french-fries?. I learned from YouTube.  
**Premkumar (dad):** Sorry Ara, Appa has to finish something important.  

**Aradhana (daughter):** I'm alone. I have no one to play with.  
**Premkumar (dad):** Sorry Ara, Appa has to work. Why don't you watch TV?  

**Aradhana (daughter):** Will you read me a story, tonight?.  
**Premkumar (dad):** Sorry Ara, Appa is tired.  

... and many more.

Life slipped through me in moments like this. What an idiot I was. And for what?

It's time I re-arrange my priorities and be a dad that she will remember, long after I am gone.

> Ara, I promise I'll be there for you, as long as I am alive.  I love you.
