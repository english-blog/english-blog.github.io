<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<br /></div>
Why this post?. What is it that I want to communicate to the world about HDFC Bank?. Just my recent bitter experiences with HDFC. I have been banking with HDFC for the past 7 years. I am one of the high value card member who always pays in full and never defaulted a single payment in my life. Here is what happened...<br />
<br />
I came back from California on 21-Jun-2011, stayed in B'lore for two days and I went for a vacation for my brother's marriage. Very unfortunately, I lost my HDFC Platinum credit card 5243-XXXX-XXXX-8957 on 23-Jun-2011 and took a new mobile number in Chennai. I did not use the card for the past 6 months and I almost forgot the email statements. My new mobile number is not updated in HDFC Bank records. :)<br />
<br />
Someone used my card like his own and purchased items from Jewellery, Dish TVs, Mobile phones, MP3 players, Shoes, Sarees, School bags for kids and even groceries for about Rs. 1 lakh. Even I did not use my card like this. OK. So far, so good.<br />
<br />
I got the statement on 25-Jul-2011 and I was very much surprised to see the transactions and realized that I lost my card. I called up HDFC Bank and blocked the card immediately. HDFC Bank advised me to file an FIR with the police station. I went to HAL police station and surprised to know that the police NEVER file an FIR for credit card loss. The police push these cases under <a href="http://www.vakilno1.com/bareacts/indianpenalcode/S403.htm">Section 403</a>. Banks know this. Hmmm... I got an acknowledgement from the Police and formally registered a compliant with Risk Control Unit of HDFC Bank. Ref # ULRL1208110009224. RCU informed me that they will start the investigation and I do not need to pay anything till the investigation is over. I was very happy :)<br />
<br />
Meanwhile, I got the next month's statement with all the transactions + interest + late payment charges, followed by a phone call from HDFC Customer <i>Care </i>(?). The guy on the phone was very harsh, shouted at me for not paying the dues. I got pissed off and shouted back at him left and right. I called up RCU to check and they said that their investigation systems and the statement generation systems are not in sync and they do not work together. They asked me to ignore the&nbsp;statements&nbsp;and the phone calls till the investigation is over.&nbsp;I was like $!@#$%^&amp;*. <i><b>Why don't you guys work together?</b></i><br />
<br />
After few weeks, Mr. Prakash collected the details of all the merchants and the video footage of the thief from the CC TV of the last merchant, where the card is declined. Here is the video.<br />
<br />

<br />
(<i>The guy in white shirt behind the red shirt is the thief. He stays somewhere near Kadugodi in bangalore. Anyone happens to see him, please call Prem @98869-71858. Thank You!</i>)<br />
<br />
So far so good. Mr. Prakash promised me to accompany to the Police station and file an FIR with the evidences that its not a loss, but a fraud too. Three weeks passed and no response from him after repeated calls and SMS. Meanwhile, I was sending emails to HDFC bank for the same. Mr. Madhu was assigned for this case and he took me to Airport Road Police Station. He said they are his friends and will investigate without FIR. I insisted on an FIR. He said, "<b><i>The card was lost near ITPL and you stay in Marathahalli. Both the areas does not come under this police station. So, they cannot file an FIR. The HAL Police won't be of much help. That's why I brought you here. If you don't like, pay the entire amount to HDFC Bank. Your choice !</i></b>". I was little surprised when Mr. Madhu asked me to pay Rs.3000 to the police to start the investigation. <i><b>Would you like to pay Rs. 1 lakh to the bank or Rs. 3000 to the police?. Since they do this for you off the record, you need to pay for their travel expenses.</b> - </i>Argument from Mr. Madhu (an HDFC Bank Representative). I paid to Mr.Venkata Swamy @ Airport Road Police Station. Yes. I did. I just wanted this to get over. But the Police is still searching the thief (as of 23-Oct-2011).<br />
<br />
While all these are happening, my credit card statement was filled with interests and late payment charges (remember, I was advised by RCU that I need not make any payments). I was not sure how long this case is going to continue. So, I sent an email to the bank stating that "<i>Please cancel all the interests / whatever charges that the Bank imposed on my account and convert all the transactions into EMI (without interest). I will pay the EMI of the credit card theft amount.</i>"<br />
<br />
HDFC Bank promptly replied, "<i>We regret to inform you that we are unable to process your request of conversion of the said transaction into Equated Monthly installments. We sincerely regret the inconvenience caused to you as we are unable to accede to your request at this point of time. We request our cardholders to effect required payment towards the card dues to avoid levy of applicable bank charges.</i>"<br />
<br />
Both the HDFC Bank and I know that, it was a fraud on my card. <i><b>I don't want HDFC Bank to lose money because of my carelessness.</b></i> I offered to pay the entire amount, knowing that the thief may not be caught at all. All I asked is just to remove the interests and other charges. Is that too big a request for HDFC bank?.<br />
<br />
<b>Lessons Learnt from this Credit Card Fraud:</b><br />
<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Always keep your mobile number updated with your Banks. They send SMS for each and every transactions.</li>
<li>If you have the habit of switching mobile numbers when going to home town/vacation, please double check that your credit/debit cards are safe and with you.</li>
<li>"Zero Liability" is a scam used by ALL the banks. It covers the transactions happened after you report the loss of card to the Bank. In reality, it takes few seconds to block the card after you report. How many transactions can happen in those few seconds?. So, don't trust this and exercise extra caution.</li>
<li>Avoid Credit Cards if possible. The banks make a lot of money and you get peanuts in the name of reward points. Warren Buffet advises NOT to use Credit Cards and says "<a href="http://www.warrenbuffett.com/warren-buffett-10-ways-to-get-rich/">Limit What You Borrow</a>".&nbsp;</li>
<li>I am not using Credit Cards for close to an year now and I am as good as before. I can better manage my expenses now. Trust me. There is NO big difference.</li>
<li>I suggest to get a credit card and use it ONLY for emergencies and make sure that you pay it off in FULL. Never ever get into revolving mode. You get stuck !.</li>
<li>Never pay anything to the Police. It does not make any big difference. Go to the court, if you have time !.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<b>What HDFC Bank Could have done better?</b><br />
<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>For a high value transaction for Rs.38,500 @ Chemmanur Jewellery, HDFC Bank tried to send an SMS and followed by a phone call. The main reason for phone call verification is to avoid credit card fraud. When you are not able to reach the customer, please pro-actively make efforts to reach the customer. You could have sent an email and / or temporarily block the card. I would be more than happy rather than pissed off.</li>
<li>Integrate all your internal systems (statement systems, RCU etc) and make sure that you know everything before calling the customer.</li>
<li>Please advise your customer care representatives to be polite while talking to the customers. Review the customer's payment history and get to know the customer before making assumptions.</li>
<li>When the customer is loyal and trying to settle all the dues with sincere efforts, please assist by providing him options.&nbsp;</li>
<li>The customers know that banks come to the settlement for a less amount when customers are not ready to pay the dues. I do not want to force HDFC bank to such a situation, since my morality does not allow that.</li>
<li>Please remember "The Customer is the King" and treat him as such. Once the dues are settled, I will move on to another bank. You have just lost a customer. Please don't lose many more. All the best !</li>
</ul>
<br />

<br />
Alexander the Great was known and called as “Sikandar” in India after his invasion. So, wait! Is the book “Sikandar” penned by Binayak Banerjee in Bengali and translated to English by Soma Ghosh about Alexander or some Indian king? Curiosity led me to book back. As soon as I read the gist of the story from the last page, I could not help thinking about Stone Cold Steve Austin’s movie “The Condemned”. The story of the movie is that 10 condemned criminals will be left to fight in an island and only one will survive. The plot of this novel is similar, where the author has attempted to portray 10 tangled personalities, the turmoil and vehemence between them, who are locked under the same roof contesting in a reality show. This could be Binayak’s original idea, but a movie was already made out of this idea. I thought "Let’s read anyway".<br />
<br />
The story begins with a news broadcast where the newsreader does a live report with the participants. What is so quizzing is that how come a news broadcast focuses so much only this program details that too even before it begins. For crying out loud, there is no trace about the program’s public response and popularity considering the hype given in the beginning. Each character introduces them giving a brief background. The one who leaves the house last will be declared as true ‘Sikandar’. The contestants are diversified. They range from a prominent politician to a poor guy, leaving the reader snooping who the winner will be. Author has beautifully portrayed the other side of celebrities giving us a look into their fears, passion, greed and humanity. However, there are high chances that the reader might get lost in the over populated characters and it’s pretty hard to track and remember character as the story progress.<br />
<br />
To add to the tousled story, comes an unsolved murder and a scandal. Pace at which the plot moves is very sluggish and fails to have a grip on the reader, though a deep insight about every character can be obtained in the run. It would have been highly intriguing had the author shed some light on how the program was broadcasted or the whereabouts of contestants’ selection. But guess what?. You do not know that till the end. Unfortunately I wasn’t able to connect with any character though there was a handful. Probably that’s why it didn’t come close to my heart and gave me a feel “It is just yet another book.” The novel leaves you wondering, “What the author is trying to tell in the end?” Despite all these drawbacks, the climax was totally unpredictable and also gives you the flavor of the reality shows’ shadow side though how hard you think you will never be able to figure the logic behind it. Although I haven’t read the Bengali version, I somehow felt that translation hasn’t crippled the essence and originality. Good work Soma!<br />
<br />
To sum up in a single line ‘Sikandar is a kaleidoscope’. It shows different colors and patterns but no value or moral to back up. Can be chosen to read casually or for a train journey.<br />

If a picture is worth thousand words, how about a video then?. Here is an introductory video to EFT (Emotional Freedom Technique). It is very essential that you know about EFT, before reading the review about this book. I found this is the best video that was ever made for EFT. Watch it completely before you scroll down for the book review.<br />

<b>Book:</b> Musings Of A Wanderer<br />
<b>Author:</b> Shreya Chatterjee<br />
<b>ISBN:</b> 9381205006<br />
<b>ISBN-13:</b> 9789381205006, 978-9381205006<br />

<br />
"Not a poet, but an off tune mind that dares to speak in free verse." - That's how Shreya writes in the preface. I completely agree with her. I had huge expectation before reading this book. But, I was disappointed. Since, this is her first book on poetry, I am OK. I guess, She should have waited for some more time to improve her skills, get feedback from different sources (not just friends), refine her skills and then should have come to the publishing world. Print media is completely different from the blog media. Once printed, it stays in history. Instead of publishing all she has written, she should have selected the best few and make a best first impression.<br />
<br />
Poems - to me is a mean to convey the feelings from one mind to another. The scene, the situation, the movie, the characters should expand in our mind, when we read the poems. We should feel that we are part of what's happening or at least we are witnessing it. That feeling is missing in most of the poems. Some of the poems read like news. However, I like some of the poems. Here are few of my likes ...<br />
<br />
1. The last company in the park<br />
2. A girl scribbling<br />
3. I will be around<br />
4. Blood<br />
5. A brother to me. (I liked this very much. I can co-relate myself to this poem)<br />
<br />
I could have simply written a review "nice book", "good to read" etc. Would that help Shreya?. I don't think so. Whatever I told is what I felt after reading the book. The reason I am very much disappointed is that my friends Sunita and Binti also write poems. They are awesome. But they are least bothered either to blog it or publish it. So, when I have a printed book in my hand, I think you can guess my expectations.<br />
<br />

<b>Book:</b> Outliers: The Story Of Success<br />
<b>Author:</b> Malcolm Gladwell<br />
<b>ISBN:</b> 0141036249<br />
<b>ISBN-13:</b> 9780141036243, 978-0141036243<br />

<br />
I knew Malcom Gladwell through his earlier book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316010669/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=booiverea-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0316010669">Blink</a>". This guy always thinks out of the box and gives a new perspective to the well known things. He always amazes me. In his new book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0316017930/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=booiverea-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=0316017930">Outliers</a>", he gives us a different perspective on Why successful people are successful?. &nbsp;The general notion is that the successful people became so, because of who they are. But, Gladwell tells us that its more because of where they are from?. Sounds confusing?. For me too, when I started. Not anymore :)<br />
<br />
He starts off with the analysis of the hockey players in Canadian teams. One interesting fact is that most of the best players in the team are born in the first three months (Jan, Feb, Mar). He concludes that its because of the selection procedure followed in Canada and the additional playing time these kids get in their early years. This is definitely a different insight and he suggest the alternate means as well.<br />
<br />
He analyses the life history of most successful software people like Bill Gates, Steve Jobs, Bill Joy, the most successful&nbsp;entrepreneurs like Rockefeller, Andrew Carnegie, the most successful lawyers like Joe Flom, the most successful music troops like Beatles, the most successful immigrants like Louis and Regina Borgenicht etc and figures out the components that made them the Outliers.&nbsp;Some of them are...<br />
<br />
The Time of their birth (right time)<br />
The&nbsp;Opportunities&nbsp;they got (right place)<br />
The Hard work they put in (10,000 hrs rule - right attitude)<br />
<br />
He concludes that these Outliers were present in the right time in the right place with the right attitude and become successful. He takes the examples of few other intellectual people who, unfortunately happen to be in the wrong time and not be able to become a success icon. Interesting, but I could not buy into this idea 100%.<br />
<br />
I thought about the book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1582701709/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=booiverea-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=1582701709">The Secret</a>" by Rhonda Brynes when I read Gladwell's conclusion. Gladwell says that Outliers are successful, because of the&nbsp;opportunities they got. But, Rhonda Bryne says that you will create&nbsp;opportunities&nbsp;when you are determined in what you want to&nbsp;achieve, according to the "Law Of Attraction". Gladwell explains why things are the way they are. Rhonda Bryne tells us how to create things.<br />
<br />
Do you see the some correlation?. I do. I would suggest you to read the book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1582701709/ref=as_li_tf_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=booiverea-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=217145&amp;creative=399369&amp;creativeASIN=1582701709">The Secret</a>" after reading this book.<br />
<br />
In further chapters, he discusses about the "Culture of Honor", why plane crashes happens and its relation to the culture they belong to, rice paddy fields and its relations to maths skills etc. Very interesting !...<br />
<br />
Overall, a very good book. But I cannot agree with everything that he says. Its worth reading :)<br />

<br />
Thank You...&nbsp;Thank You...&nbsp;Thank You...&nbsp;Thank You...&nbsp;Thank You...<br />
<br />
This is all I can say to Dr. Gary Chapman for writing such a beautiful, much needed book. I would recommend this book to ALL, irrespective of whether you are in love, married, living together or whatever is your marital status. This book packs a lot of real wisdom which can potentially save a lot of marriages from the brink of divorce. Imagine, what this book can do to the already amazing marriages and couples?. Dr. Gary Chapman guides us to identify the means to communicate your heart felt love to your spouse.<br />
<br />
If you speak in Japanese to a Chinese, he would not understand. So, does speaking in Tamil to native Indians. Its as simple as that. People feel loved when we express love in a way that they can understand. Dr. Chapman categorizes these variations in expressing love to five categories. He starts with the emotional "In-Love" experience and why that experience fades away slowly after marriage and points out what's missing. Its not that we do not love each other anymore, its just that we consistently fail to communicate love in a way that he/she understands it. Great.<br />
<br />
Your love language and your spouses may not be the same and it could be difficult for you to learn and speak your spouse's language. But, do learn. The results are amazing.<br />
<br />
The five love languages are:<br />
<br />
<b>1. Words of Affirmation:</b> &nbsp;Simple words of affirmation/appreciation from your heart. Appreciating the simple things that your spouse does for you. For some people, words mean much more than anything else in the world. These simple appreciations goes a long way in building that special relationship that everyone longs for.<br />
<br />
<b>2. Quality Time:</b> By quality time, he means giving your undivided attention to your spouse frequently. May be sitting with her in the couch and talking to her for 15 minutes a day (remember to switch off the TV). Listen. Let her talk. Don't give solutions, if she did not ask for it. Learning to listen could be difficult for many men. On an average we could listen for 7 seconds, before we pump our thoughts into the discussion. Just listen. Or just spend time with her. Go for a walk. Do things together.&nbsp;As simple as that. For many women, this means a lot. Quality time during the extreme happiness and during crisis will remain in her memory till her last breath.<br />
<br />
<b>3. Receiving Gifts:</b> The gifts need not be expensive and we know that everyone cannot afford. But, gifts are the token of love which remains for a long time. You could pick up the flower in the back yard. Make a gift card by yourself or enroll yourself in an art class, just for creating a gift for her. Gift her and touch her heart and you get everything from her :)<br />
<br />
<b>4. Acts of Service:</b> Some people express their love to their spouse by service. Jesus is a perfect example of this type. For some, giving gifts or spending time with her or praising her wont mean much, when the house is a mess, clothes all over the rooms and the yards need maintenance. So, if your spouses love language is Acts of Service, the only way to her heart is by doing things for her. May be, cleaning the dishes, doing the laundry and taking care of the baby when she is not well etc,.<br />
<br />
<b>5. Physical Touch:</b> Most men misunderstand that this is their primary language. By Physical Touch, Dr. Chapman doesn't refer only Sexual Intercourse. Of course&nbsp;that's&nbsp;most important for almost every men. But, need not necessarily be your primary love language. This language means holding the hands together, hugging, kissing, rubbing the back, sitting close in the couch and feeling great when your partner touches you (even in the day when you don't have sex).<br />
<br />
Dr. Chapman provides a quiz &amp; scoring system for men and women at the end to help us identify our primary love language. Many of us will be bi-lingual and multilingual. Understand your primary love language and your spouse's love language and speak love. Happy Married Life !!!<br />
<br />
PS: Here is my order of love languages for the girls who are interested to touch my heart... hehehe :)<br />
1. Physical Touch - 12<br />
2. Quality Time - 8<br />
3. Words of Affirmation - 6<br />
4. Receiving Gifts - 3<br />
5. Acts of Service - 1<br />

January 24, 2008 - The World Economic Forum, Davos,&nbsp;Switzerland. A speech by Bill Gates, one of the most successful&nbsp;entrepreneur &amp;amp; philanthropist created a whirl wind in the business circles. Gates proposed a new idea of making capitalism work for the poor and needy in the developing world. He coined the term "Creative Capitalism". This book is a compilation of discussions, blogs, critics by 43 well known successful business leaders, economists etc around the topic. Micheal Kinsley did a pretty good job in compiling 300+ pages with thought provoking ideas, approaches to Creative Capitalism. Many of you may have seen Gates speech on youtube or read the transcription in Microsoft website. But, after reading this entire book, you will have a complete knowledge, different thinking and a birds eye view of this topic. About the pros and cons of what was proposed by Bill Gates. Many of the business leaders do not agree with his idea of Creative Capitalism (with valid statistics and business ethics). Some, do agree with Bill Gates.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/billg/speeches/2008/01-24wefdavos.mspx" target="blank">Bill Gates: World Economic Forum 2008</a><br />
<br />
<b>Here is the cheat sheet of Creative Capitalism:</b><br />
1. Markets respond only to "demand", not to "need".<br />
2. The world is getting better, but not fast enough and not for everyone. For ex., Climate change will impose the worst effect on those least responsible for it.<br />
3. In a system of pure capitalism, the incentive to serve people rises as their wealth rises and falls as their wealth falls. This needs to be changed so that there is an incentive to serve poor people too.<br />
4. A revised capitalist system would&nbsp;both&nbsp;make a profit and improve the lives of the have-nots.<br />
5. Creative Capitalism is a system where incentives for both profit and recognition motivate both self-interest and caring for others.<br />
6. Under Creative Capitalism governments, businesses and non-profits works together.<br />
7. Some real world scenarios are : Corporations donating money or products. Tiered pricing by drug companies for vaccines against diseases affecting third world. Help poor world business do business in developed world. The Bono RED campaign model.<br />
8. Corporations should allow "top innovators" to spend part of their times on issues facing people too poor to be customers. This "takes the brainpower that makes life better for the richest, and dedicates it to improving the lives of everyone else".<br />
<br />
The book starts with the conversation with Warren Buffet, Bill Gates and author Micheal Kinsley. They discuss in detail about all the possibilities of making this concept to the real world. To my perception, Warren Buffet is much more experienced and knows what he puts forth on the table. Bill Gates is very impatient and wants to change the world very fast. Just like switching on a PC and start working. Warren Buffet suggests to tax 3% from the corporation and let a neutral body consisting of Government officials, Business leaders and NGO manage the fund to make the world a better place for everyone.<br />
<br />
But Gates proposes a different approach, where the businesses using its technology &amp;amp; resources get into the field of&nbsp;philanthropy&nbsp;directly. He urges the businesses to explore the unexploited business&nbsp;opportunities&nbsp;available in the sub-saharan&nbsp;African&nbsp;countries and thereby improving the lives of the less&nbsp;privileged&nbsp;people. He urges the corporations to donate huge amounts of money, resources or employees time for those who cannot afford it. What would the businesses get in return?. Recognition as do-gooders which will improve the company's reputation and in turn improves the profits. The ultimate aim is again profit&nbsp;maximization. But, he does not mention who has to make the decision to decide the charitable cause. The corporate managers or the share holders or the stake holders?. There are a lot of practical complications around this. This could be an easy option for the companies that are about to go to IPO.<br />
<br />
Hundreds of pages discussing about each and every specific good and bad things in Gates speech. How is it different from Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR)?. Why do we need a different form of capitalism?. etc. I&nbsp;feel good about Bill Gates intention to eradicate poverty in the world through Creative Capitalism. But just the intention is not enough. A complete real world implementation plan is needed to make that a reality. Apart from the speech made at Davos, what else has been done in the past three years?. Where are we in this idea?. What Gates has done other than making a speech?.<br />
<br />
We need more people like Gates to come together and persist in the idea, so that it becomes a goal of every corporation in this world. I would suggest everyone interested in business or has that entrepreneurial instincts to read this book. It will prepare you to help others and at the same time, survive the competition.<br />

<b>Book: </b>Happier Than God - Turn Ordinary Life Into An Extraordinary Experience<br />
<b>Author:</b> Neale Donald Walsch<br />
<b>ISBN:</b> 1571745807<br />
<b>ISBN-13:</b> 9781571745804,978-1571745804<br />

<br />
This book was waiting for me in a book shop in Kolkata and found me finally. At least that's what the author Neale Donald Walsh says in the first few pages of the book. I have read his earlier book "Conversations with God". His writing style is such that he will ask many thought provoking questions, makes you think and finally leaves you confused. You need to read his text again and again to get him right. I have not got him right yet. But, you get the core message at some level. Just as I did.<br />
<br />
"Life was meant to be happy". What a quote to start a book with!. This one line describes the context of the entire book. This book starts with the explanation of God and the perfect way for us to communion with God. Since, I am an atheist from the day I started asking questions, I could not comprehend most of the items discussed in the first few chapters. The author told, it would be the case, but I will get it in the end. Some how I was too intelligent to get the idea of God at the end. Many people claim that they understand God better after reading Donald's books. You may also get to understand God. Please read.</div>
<br />
Once he explains God, he goes on to discuss about the concept of "The Law of Attraction" which was made very popular by Rhonda Bryne in the movie "The Secret". He claims that the manifestation process taught by the new age spiritual teachers reveals only the half of the Unspoken Truth. Then he reveals "The Process of Personal Creation" - a larger, revised version of the law of attraction. Life expresses itself through.<br />
<br />
1. The Energy Of Attraction<br />
2. The Law Of Opposites<br />
3. The Gift Of Wisdom<br />
4. The Joy Of Wonder<br />
5. The Presence Of Cycles.<br />
<br />
Good read. Too big to explain in a short review of this book. If you liked "The Secret", you will like this book as well,&nbsp; but it would be contradictory and confusing for you. Be prepared. The next few chapters are dedicated to this Process of Personal Creation. What to do and what not to do etc. He ends the books with 17 steps to being happier than God, which I absolutely love.<br />
<br />
1. Bring an end to Separation Theology<br />
2. Stay in touch with who you are<br />
3. Give others every experience you seek<br />
4. Be clear that nothing you see is real<br />
5. Decide that you are not your story<br />
6. Have only preferences<br />
7. See the perfection<br />
8. Bypass the drama<br />
9. Understand sadness<br />
10. Stop arguing with life<br />
11. Drop all expectations<br />
12. Have compassion for yourself<br />
13. Speak your truth as soon as you know it<br />
14. Watch the energies, catch the vibe<br />
15. Smile<br />
16. Sing<br />
17. Know what to do when things are really bad<br />
<br />
Some of these may not make sense at first. If you read the explanations, you would agree. Its is true that you will feel happier after reading this book. I closed this book with a smile on my face. I wish you should have similar experience. Order the book now !!!<br />

I got this book as a birthday gift from a friend. I really don't have a clue, how my friends know exactly what I want. Thanks a lot to all my lovely friends.&nbsp;I like listening to speeches by great men. When I was in Florida during the 2008 presidential campaign, I followed each and every speech by Barack Obama. He inspired me very much. I want to become the best orator and with my speech I want to bring the best out of every human and spread love. There are many books available with similar titles, collection of great speeches by great men. This is one among them and is a collection of 42 speeches in English, arranged in chronological order.<br />
<br />
I would call any book as a good book, if leaves an impact on you, if it changes your perception about something, if it stays in your memory for a long time, if you feel bad that the book is over and if you want to read it again and again. Surprisingly this book does everything. I cannot contribute all to the author Edward Humphreys, because he just collected all the speeches and put together in one single book. But, definitely my thanks to him for his effort.<br />
<br />
This book includes speeches by the Kings, Queens, Pastors, Political Leaders, Red Indians, Black Women, Non Political Leaders etc.&nbsp;Remember, every speech in this book is made for a specific purpose at a specific time in history for a specific set of people.&nbsp;If you read all the speeches, you can differentiate between the speeches that withstand time and the ones which does not. The speeches once considered as the best, does not appear best to me. Its looks very normal. So, what makes the difference?. What are the components of the speech that makes it withstand time?. Is it the emotional quotient?. Is it the plain simple facts delivered in straight forward way?. Is it the eloquent usage of words?. Is it just the man behind the mike and his reputation?. Is it the power of the speaker that takes the reader back to the history?. Or Is it because the reader can relate himself to the speech?. I do not know now. But I will definitely find out.<br />
<br />
I do not know many people in this book. Glad to know them now. Let me give you a gist of the speeches in this book.<br />
<br />
<b>Elizabeth I - The Golden Speech.</b> This speech is considered one of the greatest of all English Monarch. I opened the book with lots of curiosity, but you know what?. I was disappointed. I expected a speech that shows power and authority, but its very humble and down to earth. Like a sermon from a pastor. Sucks !<br />
But If you read Margaret Thatcher's speech "The Lady's Not For Turning", you can feel the power, command and authority in it.<br />
<br />
<b>James Wolfe - Speech Before The Battle Of The Plains Of Abraham.</b> - The man who brought about the end of New France. "<i>The impossibility of retreat makes no difference in the situation of men resolved to conquer or die; and, believe me friends, if your conquest be bought with the blood of your general, he would most cheerfully resign a life which he has long devoted to his country</i>". He died and won the battle. Very inspiring.<br />
<br />
<b>Patrick Henry - Give Me Liberty Or Give Me Death</b> - This man and his speech started the American Revolutionary War. "<i>Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be bought at the price of chains and slavery?. Forbid it, Almighty God! I know not what course others may take; but for me, give me liberty, or give me death!&nbsp;</i>". Each and every line is inspiring.<br />
<br />
<b>Tecumseh</b> - The Shawnee Chief, challenging the Treaty of Fort Wayne in 1810. "<i>Sell a Country! Why not sell the air, the clouds and the Great Sea, as well as the earth?. Did not the Great Good Spirit make them all for the use of his children? </i>". Thought provoking speech from a Red Indian, which shows the ugly face of the origin of America.<br />
<br />
<b>Sojourner Truth - Ain't I a woman?</b> - This small speech by a former black slave at the two day Convention devoted to the rights of woman, is very emotional. Not any facts, Not any wisdom. Just the plain emotional venting of years of torture and slavery. But, one of the best !<br />
