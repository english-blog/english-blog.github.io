          <h2>What is love?</h2>

<p>Science says that its a side effect of few chemicals like oxytocin, vasopressin, dopamine, serotonin etc. If the release of these hormones is blocked, our LOVE fades away...Oops!!!... In other words, scientists can make two people fall in love with an injection?...(Cupid becomes jobless?). They can even find the exact love-genes of the individuals and produce specific chemicals to attract that specific person... Who knows, it could even become the fastest, easiest and safest way to fall in love, in this fast paced life...Scary and sounds more like a next century sci-fi movie...  </p>

<p>But...  </p>

<p>Is that all?.  </p>

<p>Is that all to this wonderful feeling called love?.  </p>

<p>Can anyone explain why do we fall in love with someone, rather than others?.  </p>

<p>Which is that moment, that changes your perception of her from a normal girl to an angel from heaven?  </p>

<p>A flash of smile, a minute spent together or a comment from a cab driver?. What triggers that emotion within you?  </p>

<p>What makes <em>this</em> person so different and attractive from the others?.  </p>

<p>Why is that her very presence make you feel excited and happy?.  </p>

<p>Suddenly you feel great for being short, because she is short? (funny for most, but true to some)  </p>

<p>Even, just a thought about her pushes you to cloud nine.  </p>

<p>Even when she rejects you, you think about her all the time.  </p>

<p>Even when she doesn&#39;t want to see you around, you want her to be happy always and see her from a distance.  </p>

<p>When there are millions of other potential girls around, you wait restlessly for a <em>single</em> chance to prove your love?  </p>

<p>Day in, day out, your love deepens into your heart by leaps and bounds.  </p>

<p>What makes these guys to move mountains for the one they love?  </p>

<p>I am searching an answer for this question.  </p>

<p>I am searching, with an intention from my heart NOT to find the answer. Strange! Isn&#39;t it?.  </p>

<p>What happened to me?.  </p>

<p>Love can only be experienced, and can never be written. Attempting to write them results in a scribble, like this!.  </p>

<p>Love is a great feeling, with no past and future. Its always present in all of us. Once you experience love, you will continue to radiate love to all.  </p>

<p>When you are in love, don&#39;t wait for the right moment.  </p>

<p>NOW is the right time, HERE is the right place, SHE is the right person. Go, tell her. Period.  </p>

<p><strong>PS:</strong> I wanted to pen down my perception about love, but ended up having more questions, with no answers. Its feels great though!.  </p>
