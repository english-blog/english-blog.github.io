<p>Should I really write a review for Robin Sharma&#39;s book?. His name stands better than the best book-review anyone could write for his book. Hmm... let me share some of the insights that are spread throughout this book. This book packs 15 yrs of his leadership advisory experience, which was once a closely guarded secret. Robin tried to make this book interesting by using the story of an Iraq war vet Blake Davis.  </p>

<p>Blake served in Iraq war and is having tough time transitioning to civilian life. He is having trouble with the relationships and job. Tommy, his father&#39;s friend comes to his life and introduces him the philosophy of &quot;LWT - Lead Without a Title&quot;. Blake gets introduced to four different teachers and learns the philosophy with atmost interest. Transformation of Blake from playing victim-hood to leading is described very naturally.   </p>

<p>This book is packed with a hell lot of quotes from well known personalities all over the world. Some of the quotes from Robin are awesome. Lots of acronyms are used and lots of repetition to instill these concepts in reader&#39;s mind. Robin Sharma summarizes the philosophy under four different principles, taught by four different teachers. The teachers Anna, Ty, Jackson and Jet are striking different from each other, but follows the same principle.  </p>

<p>I would like to give a glimpse of these four principle, but suggest you to read the book to grasp it completely.  </p>

<p><strong>Principle 1: You need no title to be a leader.</strong><br>
Leadership is not reserved to the selected few who lead the organizations or the countries. Everyone has the power and potential to lead by example. You need to be very innovative and be a master at whatever you do. Be it street sweeping or an exquisite art work of calibrating diamonds or a CEO. Be a master of it. Be authentic and have guts to take difficult decisions when the rest of the world hides in the cocoon. You should have you own value systems or ethics to guide you along your route.  </p>

<p><strong>Principle 2: Turbulent times build great leaders.</strong><br>
Remember the old quote, &quot;Smooth seas never make a skilled sailor&quot;. But how often, do we remember this?. Robin sharma devotes more pages to this principle than the rest and pushes the principle into our mind, without us realizing it. Its good. &quot;Life begins at the end of the comfort zone&quot;. Lets celebrate the tough time with a big smile :)  </p>

<p><strong>Principle 3: The deeper your relationship, the stronger your leadership.</strong><br>
I cannot emphasize the importance of this principle in our life. Be it, professional or personal , relationships are very very important. DON&#39;T break any relationship in your life, whatever the reason are. At the end of the life - money, power, position, college degree doesn&#39;t matter. Its the fulfilling relationships that you have earned, matters. So, go for it. Just mingle with everyone, have fun. Thats what we are all here for !!!  </p>

<p><strong>Principle 4: To be a great leader, first become a great person.</strong><br>
This principle details about the personal life of a leader. The importance needs to be given for the personal health, family, friends, fun-time and self-realization. Robin Sharma gives seven essential steps to become a great person.  </p>

<ol>
<li>Learning<br></li>
<li>Affirmations<br></li>
<li>Visualization<br></li>
<li>Journaling<br></li>
<li>Goal setting<br></li>
<li>Exercise<br></li>
<li>Nutrition<br></li>
</ol>

<p>I am doing most of these and I know the importance of these first hand. Please try and transform.  </p>

<p>This is not just another book, which you will read and stack it in your library. Make this a constant companion and keep it in your coffee table. Refer this book as often as you want. Its worth every penny.  </p>
