<p>&quot;The 4-hour work week - Escape the 9-5, live anywhere and join the new rich.&quot; The book, which transformed few of my beliefs, addressed the fears that I had in me, without me knowing that. Tim painted new colors in my dream picture, with his own and I love it.  </p>

<p>This book is constructed into 4 major groups - DEAL - (Definition, Elimination,Automation &amp; Liberation) with multiple chapters. Many chapters end with Q&amp;A. I would suggest you to take time to answer those questions. If you just flip through the pages, without associating your own life, I doubt this book will make any difference, other than leaving you in surprise. The book begins with the definition of the &quot;New Rich&quot; and Tim&#39;s real life story.  </p>

<p>In the first group <strong>D - Definition</strong>, the author discusses about the differences between the NR and others, identifying the goals and introduces Dreamline and TMI. &quot;The fat man in the red BMW convertible&quot; - this metaphor made me think a lot. Thats what most of the ultra-successfull millionaires look like. I do not have the slightest interest to become one of them. The comfort challenges like eyegazing, proposing, getting phone numbers etc are really good. I even suggested them to my friend and he is happy. (I do that already, so did need it)  </p>

<p>The second group <strong>E - Elimination</strong> is what I would suggest everyone to read. Even if you love to work more than 8 hrs a day, these simple tips and techniques will help you to perform better. The 80/20 principle and the parkinson&#39;s law are explained with live examples. Tips on selective ignorance and time management are excellent. For ex. The number of times, you check emails on a busy day and the time you lose with interruption those emails brings is directly propotional. I started checking emails only few times in a day and close &quot;Lotus Notes&quot; (Email client) as soon as I am done with reading emails. You won&#39;t believe, it looks very simple, but very productive. The emails which I use to respond immediately were not that urgent, than the things that I was doing.  </p>

<p>The third group <strong>A - Automation</strong>. Introduced a lot of new things. Outsourcing your day to day mundane activities to a virtual assistant is completely new to me and I am gonna hire a VA for me :) The idea of separating income from your time spent is really required for having a mobile lifestyle. Since the author followed the path of the entreprenour, he discloses all the tips and tricks of marketing, products, afffiliations, royalty, licensing etc. But mine is a different ball game related to creativity, so these chapters took a little more time to complete.  </p>

<p>The last group <strong>L - Liberation</strong>. Starts with the tips on how to escape from the office. ha ha ha ah.. no.. not in the way you think. Instead of working for 30 - 45 years and planning for a retirement, the author suggests mini-retirements of three to six months, which is completely practical and wil give you a glimpse of how your retirement will feel like. After one mini-retirement, your perception about retirements will definetly change and you are still young to change the decisions ;). He provides the practical tips and step by step instructions for your mini-retirements and a tour around the world.  </p>

<p>The in last few &quot;Restricted Reading&quot; chapters, the author lists down the books, resources that you will need for a vagabonding life. This book packed more information that It could possibly include. It was a very pleasure experience reading a book like this. Try it :)  </p>
