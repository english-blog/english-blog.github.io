<a href="http://www.stevechandler.com/index.html" target="_blank">Steve Chandler</a> is one of the most sought after personal development guru in America and the best selling author of over 30 books. This audio book in his own voice is more than a decade old, but still holds good to this world.<br />
<br />
Everybody needs motivation to achieve their goals. As humans, we cannot be high on motivation all the time. We do reach stressful low situations sometimes and we do certain things to bounce back. Everybody has their own ways to keep the motivation level high. Steve tells you 100 different ways to keep motivate yourself in this audio book. Many of them are different, offer a different perspective and alters the way I think. I did compile a list of my favourite items from this 100 in a notepad. I will frequent this notepad again and again to keep me motivated towards my goals. Thank you Steve for this collection.<br />
<br />
<b>Some of my favorites are: (just a gist - listen to him for detailed explanation)</b><br />
<br />
1. <b>Kill Your Television</b> - One side of the glass is the people who do and on the other side, the people who watch. Which side you belong to?. Never thought in this perspective.<br />
<br />
<b></b>2. <b>Leave Your Friends</b> - who does not support your goals or share your vision. This one would be tough. I have a lot of friends who are really good at heart, but ridicule/laugh at my every goal, idea or vision. Eventually I stopped sharing my ideas with them. Steve suggests to do that early. There are billions of other people who can help you propel ahead.<br />
<br />
3.&nbsp;<b>Run Towards Your Fears -&nbsp;</b>Something safe and better wait on the other side of your fear.<br />
<br />
4. <b>Read Yourself a Success Story</b> - Yes. Read Aloud. I learnt this technique in a voice acting course by Dr Prakash. It has helped me immensely. Pick up a book of success stories and read aloud to yourself a success story everyday. This works.<br />
<b></b><br />
5. <b>Just be Unexpected</b> - Do what makes you tick. Write, Collaborate, Create. Do anything you want. Creativity does not mean originality. Build upon other's work, create a better version of it or simply share other's work, if you don't have a clue about creativity. Don't let the "<i>Originality</i>" idea prevent you from doing something good.<br />
<br />
6. <b>Act Like a Hero</b> - Damn. I do this from my childhood. Whenever I go to a movie and impressed with the hero, I think myself as the hero in the movie. I feel awesome. Without heroes, we are plain simple boring people. Choose as many heroes as you want, and try to act like one (doesn't mean to jump like spiderman)<br />
<br />
7. <b>Say NO to yourself</b> - Seriously?. Yes. Sometimes. Especially when it comes to discipline. Your body and mind will come up with creative questions to keep you in the bed. Don't listen to them. Say NO. Become your own disciple. Do 2 things daily that you don't want to do. Assume that those are the orders from your guru version of yourself. Do it, no matter what you think.<br />
<br />
8. <b>Get up on the right side of the bed</b> - Waking up with a high sense of purpose, motivates your brain to keep moving forward. Just wake up.<br />
<br />
9. <b>Welcome Your Problems</b> - Every solution has a problem in first place. So, welcome yours and strive to work towards the solution.<br />
<br />
10. <b>Drive to a Library</b> - Trust me, this would be the best spent miles on your car. Drive to a library at regular intervals and pick up a book of your choice or get a book online.<br />
<b><br /></b>
11. <b>Replace your Habits</b> - Many of us have unhealthy or not-so-good habits, which we want to stop. Those habits cannot be killed instantly. They must be replaced with a new, healthy &amp; positive one.<br />
<b><br /></b>
12. <b>Get some Coaching</b> - I have been hearing this advice from almost all of the self help gurus out there. I never had a life coach in my life. But, beginning to think that I should have one. I am getting into intellectual conversations with few of my friends which helps me to clarify my thinking and made to make substantial changes in my life. If I could benefit from my friends, I would definitely benefit from a coach. I shall get one soon.<br />
<br />
13. <b>Perform Rituals</b> - My favorite lesson from Robin Sharma. After I started to wake up at 5 AM daily, I began my morning rituals and understand by practice, the importance of rituals. It does not matter how much time you spend on rituals. It could be 5 mins or 3 hrs (like me). What matters is that you do it consistently to see the benefits. You can see the rituals that I perform <a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2013/08/48-days-challenge-wake-up-at-5-am-daily.html">here</a>.<br />
<br />
14. <b>Keep All your Promises</b> - No matter what happens, fulfill your promises. Think twice before making a promise and never back out from it, once it is made. The pride and self-confidence that you get out of fulfilling your promises against odd situations, is more valuable to your personal growth than anything else in this world.<br />
<br />
15. <b>Be a List writer</b> - Break them down to lists. Anything. Be it a problem, solution, suggestion, ideas, planing for a trip. Anything. Just list them down to small activities. Once you write them down in paper in the form of lists, the task at hand seems simple and do-able. Just do it.<br />
<br />
These are just a few of the 100&nbsp;+ bonus tips explained in this audio book. Get the book to explore more !!!<br />

<b>Book Name:</b> Zero Limits - The Secret Hawaiian System for Wealth, Health, Peace, and More<br />

<br />
The previous book that I read, <a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2013/09/attract-money-now-audio-book-review.html">Attract Money Now</a> lead me to this extra-ordinary book "Zero Limits". I must say that I am impressed with the "Ho'oponopono"concepts discussed in this book. This is something that I never heard of before. Ho'oponopono is an modern version of an ancient Hawaiian healing system. This modern version is called <i>Self I-Dentity through Ho'oponopono</i> (SITH). I am still trying to grasp the idea even hours after reading this book.<br />
<br />
The co-author Ihaleakala Hew Len, worked as a psychiatrist in a highly secured ward dedicated for mentally ill criminals in Hawaii State Hospital. Every criminal is chained and placed in separate rooms. There was high level of violence between the criminals and the doctors. Many hospital staff and doctors called in sick - most of them never want to work in that section. However, Dr. Hew Len cured every one of the patients without ever seeing them !!!. Yes. He never met any patient in person. Hard to believe that right?. Yes. For me too. Dr. Hew Len explains that he used Ho'oponopono method to cure the patients.<br />
<br />
<b>What is Ho'oponopono method?</b><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before understanding Ho'oponopono method, you must be clear with two things. <i>Responsibility &amp; Reality.</i><br />
<br />
<b>Responsibility </b>- How would you define it?. You are responsible for what you think, say and do. You take complete ownership of the situations &amp; problems you get into because of your actions. Also, you take pride in achieving your goals due to your persistent actions. Perfect. That's how I would also define responsibility. Are you responsible for your colleague losing her job due to layoff?. Are you responsible for the Sep 11 tragedy?. Are you responsible for the war &amp; killings in Iraq?. Will you be responsible for the War on Syria that Obama is planning?. The answer would be NO. But, Dr. Hew Len says "Yes".<br />
<br />
<b>Reality</b> - Dr. Hew Len says, "What you see outside (the real world) is nothing but the projection of your inside". When you take 100% responsibility, you are responsible for every single experience that happens in your life. You are collectively responsible for the killing in war zone or the rape of a child in the remote corner of the world. When you hear, see or experience something in your life, be it good or bad - you are co-creating the reality with the others, even though you did not consciously contribute to that specific event or experience. A part of your mind is responsible for that.<br />
<br />
Imagine this, you walk in the "Las Vegas Strip", enjoying the casinos and having fun with your friends. Suddenly, out of nowhere an insane homeless guy shouts at you and even tries to attack you - you too are responsible for that event. A part of you was not right and it was in sync with the part of the homeless guy - thus creating an experience for both of you.<br />
<br />
<b>Ho'oponopono Method: </b>This method is based on love and forgiveness. When something happens to you and it does not feel right for you, you can clean that part of you with love and forgiveness. When the cleansing is complete the experience reverses. You will be surrounded by peace. It is done by simply saying these four sentences in your mind or out loud, when you rehearse the experience in your mind or when that event is happening.<br />
<br />
I Love You.<br />
I am Sorry.<br />
Please Forgive Me.<br />
Thank You.<br />
<br />
That's it?. Yes. That's it. It is so simple but very powerful. This is the same process used by Dr. Hew Len to cure a ward of criminally insane people, without even seeing them. He will read the report about the patient and use this process to clean the part of him, which in turn cured the patient. You can apply this technique to anything and everything in your life. If you read about a sad event or tragedy happened on the other side of the world, you are responsible too. So, clean it. You can apply this method to yourself, your problems, physical pain, diseases or anything that does not seem normal and happy. There is no limit. This method is about freedom, complete freedom from the past experiences and going to the Zero State of being nothing with no experience at all. <br />
<br />
This book is filled with a whole bunch of stories and experiences of the those who practice Ho'oponopono. There are discussions about memory, inspiration, conscious mind, subconscious mind, super conscious mind ,divinity etc. As usual with Dr. Joe's hypnotic writing, you will read the book faster than you think you can. I'm serious. Read it to believe it.<br />
<br />
I already started using Ho'oponopono method and felt peace in mind, the very first day. I am planning to combine Ho'oponopono with <a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2011/09/eft-manual-book-review.html">EFT</a> and add it to my morning rituals. Let's see how it transforms my life.<br />
<br />
To learn more about the Ho'oponopono method, I suggest to look for the workshop conducted by Dr. Hew Len in Hawaii, US, Europe etc. Check the reference at the end of this blog. Another item to my Bucket List - <i>Attend Ho'oponopono workshop in Hawaii with Dr. Hew Len.</i><br />
<br />
Thank you Dr. Ihaleakala Hew Len for the Ho'oponopono method and Thank you Dr. Joe Vitale for bringing this as a book to the world.<br />

<br />
<b>What is a Blueprint for Life?</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the set of values that we live by. It is a set of rights/wrongs that we should/shouldn't do in our lives. Whether you know it or not, like it or not, everybody has a blueprint. I can simplify the term Blueprint with the term "Preference". Some people prefer to wake up early and some prefer to cuddle with bed till noon, Some prefer not to lie at any cost and some simply doesn't bother, Some doesn't drink alcohol and some drinks a lot, some prefers monogamy and some prefers polygamy. The list goes on and on, from very simple practice to the very complex situations in your life. <br />
<br />
Your habits, blueprints, preferences, thought patterns - all means the same. Your reaction to most of the situations in your life, can be predicted if your blueprint is known. You may say that you choose everything with your free will, rather than with the conditioned thought patterns. Consider this - if you never woke up before noon on any day and I ask you to wake up at 5 AM from tomorrow onwards - How easily could you do that?. If it is tough for you, then this is on your blueprint.<br />
<br />
For many people, the blueprint is set by the religion they adhere to or set by their parents in their early ages or set by the teachings of the Guru's they follow dearly. Few people knew what their blueprint is, consciously updating their blueprints as they gain new experiences in life. Rest of the human population is simply unaware that they have a blueprint.<br />
<br />
<b>Should I bother about my blueprint?</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Not required, if you are extremely happy and excited with your life and everything around you. After all, that is the only purpose of your life. Just enjoy the ride!... In case, your happiness begins to fade, then you are off the track and you must to do something to get back on track. How?. Consciously evaluate and update your blueprint. Why?. Because, your blueprint affects every little decision that you will make in your life.<br />
<br />
<b>How to list your Blueprint?</b><br />
<br />
List down all the values, practices or rituals that you live by. If you have never thought about your own set of values, you may need a little help. Imagine or think about your one complete day, from the moment you wake up till you go back to sleep. Slowly think about every single event that happens in your day. Do you see a pattern?. Do you see yourself doing the same thing again and again?. Do you see yourself behaving to the similar situation in the same way or different way each time?. Write them down.<br />
<br />
Imagine the happiest or the toughest situation in your life. Did you react in a way that you wanted to react or did you react against your will?. Did you stand for what you felt right or succumbed to the situation?. Do you have any goal?. Will you do anything to achieve that goal or only the things that you feel right?. Do you want to serve the people?. How do you react in your relationships?. You take some relationships for granted, like your mom &amp; dad?. How are you when you are with friends and compare that you being with strangers.<br />
<br />
These are some of the questions which will help you to discover your blueprints. Feel free to add more relevant questions. You may not get to know all the values in your blueprint. But you will sure get the core values which defines you. That's more than enough.<br />
<br />
<b>How to evaluate your Blueprint?</b><br />
<br />
Once you have the list of values to live by - think through each of the values in the list. Think about when this value would have been added to your blueprint. Think about the situation that caused you to adhere to this value. You will be surprised that most of your core values were formed during your childhood, mostly from your parents and society.<br />
<br />
Many times, you may not be able to point out a specific situation that changed your blueprint. It could be a series of experiences that caused the change in you. That's fine. Evaluate that specific value for it's relevance to today. If you continue with this value, will you achieve your goals or will you continue to be happy?. Will this value be relevant in future?. What are the downside of continuing this value in your life?. Are ready for that?.<br />
<br />
Once you completed the evaluation of that specific value in your blueprint, move on to the next value. When the evaluation of all the values complete, your life becomes crystal clear for you. You know what to do and what not to do. You precisely know how to react to a specific situation that is in conflict with your value system. Your life becomes easy.<br />
<br />
<b>Updating your blueprint</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As long as you live, you will encounter new experiences, meet new people that will change your perception about your life, drastically. When you feel the urge to change from inside, Change!!!. Refine your blueprint. Live with the new one. Don't hold to your old beliefs/values. I would never suggest to resist all the changes. I suggest that when you change, change consciously.<br />
<br />
<b>Other's values in your blueprint</b><br />
<br />
There many be some values in your blueprint which are imposed by others. There may be some things that you always wanted to do, but prohibited by your religion, society, family, friends, relatives etc. Those are not your values. Check the relevance of that value in your current life. Will that help you to progress in your life?. Will that keep you happy?. If yes, adhere to it and thank to whoever imposed it on you. If not, refine that value with something new and thank yourself.<br />
<br />
<b>My Blueprint:</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Below are some of the core values in my blueprint, just to give an idea of what your list might look like. I did not publish everything, though. Neither should you. There will be definitely be some values so intimate to you. Keep it with yourself.<br />
<br />
1. Never lie in any situation (If I must, I choose NOT to say anything - but never lie)<br />
2. Never fear anyone or any situation (If I fear something, voluntarily face it - till the fear fades away) <br />
3. Respect comes from within, never bother to respect everyone (this one formed during my adolescent years and I am trying to change it now)<br />
4. Eat Healthy &amp; Nutritious Food (When I first read about Raw Vegan Lifestyle during my 7th grade)<br />
5. Avoid Junk foods &amp; Carbonated Beverages (Formed after the previous value)<br />
6. Exercise regularly (Inspired by actor Surya in the Movie "Kakka Kakka")<br />
7. Wake up Early (Inspired by Robin Sharma's teachings) <br />
8. Stop Drinking &amp; Smoking (Promised my sister and adhered to it for 5 years - changed now to a social drinker)<br />

I knew <a href="http://www.mrfire.com/" target="_blank">Dr. Joe Vitale</a> from the movie, "<a href="http://thesecret.tv/" target="_blank">The Secret</a>". I use to follow his blogs for a while and lost touch in course of time. Way back in 2008, I had downloaded this book to read in future. This week was it. Its simply awesome. I wish I could have read this book much earlier in my life.<br />
<br />
I have read many books which teaches the tips, tricks and possible means to earn more money or create additional income streams. Most of them were about setting up your own business. This book is different from such other books. This does not teach about business or getting a higher paying job. This book discusses nothing that is materialistic. It's all about our minds, they way we think about money and how to alter our thinking to our favour. This book does not say, "<i>Just sit and day dream - Money will flow to you</i>". We still have to do the hard work. It just helps to keep our minds focussed on abundance, instead of scarcity - which will obviously help to achieve our goals.<br />
<br />
One good thing about this book is that, it has "action steps" at the end of each chapter which will help you to recollect what you learnt in that chapter and also to reflect your current situation with respect to the topic discussed. Please follow them. Not just in your mind. Take a pen and a paper and do the exercises. Write them down. I found this enormously useful. When you start writing your thoughts, without stopping, you will be surprised to know the hidden side of yourself. I did.<br />
<br />
Here is the gist of the 7 Steps that were discussed in this book. There were bonus materials at the end of the book too. <br />
<br />
<b>Step 1: Alter How You Think</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Limiting Beliefs - Any belief that is in conflict with your conscious goals or hinder/prevent you from achieving your goals. If your goal is to make more money, you should have a positive attitude towards money. Some people do think, "<i>Rich people are greedy</i>", "<i>Wealthy people make money with immoral acts</i>" etc., Those are not true. So, the first step is to identify, if you have any such beliefs over money or even the mild variations of such belief. Once you identified those beliefs, bring them to the light, question on the validity of those beliefs - 99.99% they are not valid. Once you consciously reason your belief and if that belief is proven wrong, it's no longer a belief for you. You are free from limiting beliefs about money. You should have a positive approach/belief to have more money in your life.<br />
<br />
<b>Step 2: Give Without Expectation</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You must tithe 10% of your income to the churches" - he he eh.. I am kidding. This is not Christianity. But the concept of tithing is a very powerful one. The author says that "Money flows". You should give as much as you receive. When you give money to others, you are in the flow. Your mind is open to abundance and free to think about other possible ways to make more money.<br />
<br />
Couple of things to note here. <br />
<br />
1.) Give without expecting anything in return. Otherwise, it becomes a business.<br />
2.) Give to the place or person where you received inspiration. Not to churches, unless you receive inspiration from church.<br />
<br />
Every week or every month or even every day, look for the place or person where you received the maximum of inspiration and give your money. It does not matter, if it is $1 or $1M. Just give what you can and you will attract more inspiration - which in turn makes you achieve more.<br />
<br />
<b>Step 3: Prosperous Spending</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spending to attract more money?. This is something that I never heard of. Joe Vitale does not talk about reckless spending and racking up the credit cards. When you have the money to buy and there is a desire to buy, go buy!. Never buy on credit. The author stresses the importance spending for ourselves. Lot of times, we get into relationships and always think about making others happy and forget about spending for us. Spend for yourself. Spend with joy. When there is happiness in spending, you are in the flow of money. This is similar to Step 2, just that you give to yourself. Money is as much about spending as receiving. This is Prosperous Spending.<br />
<br />
<b>Step 4: Ask for Help</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Asking for help is the fourth step to attracting money into your life. There is always someone out there who can help with your problems. Don't hesitate to ask for help. Just ask. Many people have resistance in asking for help, but would feel happy to help when asked. Isn't it?. This is the first level in asking for help. <br />
<br />
The second level is to form a Mastermind Group of like-minded people with similar goals - who can support each other. Make sure that the group is small and meet regularly. Your group should be such that you can openly share your goals and get support from your group - no matter how ridiculous your goal is. This is the best idea of Nepolean Hill from the world famous book "<i>Think &amp; Grow Rich</i>"<br />
<br />
<b>Step 5: Nevillize Your Goals</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When it comes to achieving your goals, you will have greater success if you make emotional connections in your mind, where you can feel, hear and experience what it will be like to actually have what you're striving for. This is the same visualization concept explained in the movie "The Secret". Imagining the end results, when working towards a goal actually increases the success rate of achieving that goal. Dr. Joe Vitale coined the word "<i>Nevillize</i>" to explain this process.<br />
<br />
You may want to test this concept. Joe suggests to have a reasonable money goal, say "<i>Attract $1000, $2000 or $5000 within the next 30 days</i>", nevillize that goal and keep an open mind for opportunities that may bring money. When you spot an opportunity, act on it immediately. You would have achieved that goal within that time. I am going to try this exercise. I will blog the results after 30 days :)<br />
<br />
<b>Step 6: Think Like an Entrepreneur</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<i>The best way to attract money is to think like an entrepreneur</i>"<br />
<br />
The reason you want more money is that you want freedom. Freedom to go anywhere, do anything, live as you please and enjoy your life to the fullest. By far, the fastest way to accelerate your income is to become an entrepreneur. What he means by this is - Look for opportunities disguised in problems and see if we could make a business out of it. With the explosion of internet to the nook and corner of the world, setting up a business is easier, faster and cheaper than ever before. Also, he suggests to set up multiple streams of income, no matter how small it is. Choose the opportunities that grow over time. <br />
<br />
<b>Step 7: Help Your Community &amp; Your World</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The seventh and final step in attracting more money is caring for your community and the world as a whole. This works hand in hand with giving - but it's not just about money. It's about sharing your time, knowledge and the lessons you have learned. So, constantly look for opportunities to give back to the society. Your success will inspire others achieve even more in their lives.<br />
<br />
As you grow, your dreams and desires will change - don't be afraid to jump on new opportunities that inspire you. This is one of the area, that I have tough times to adjust with. I hang on to too many things that I originally decided to do. I thought that was persistence. But, Dr. Joe Vitale says that we must be free to move on to new ideas that excites and inspires us. Never fear to let go of the old ideas. Let me try.<br />
<br />
More than this, there is huge list of personal development books listed at the end of this book. I was very excited and decided to read each and every one of them. I chose to read "Zero Limits" by Dr. Joe Vitale which talks about a mysterious Hawaiian healing method.<br />
<br />
Thanks Dr. Joe Vitale for this book. I will try the steps described in this book and see what happens !<br />

<i><b>18-Sep-2013</b></i>.&nbsp;
It started like any another day in the recent past. Woke up at 5 AM, brushed my teeth, drank a liter of water and ready to start my morning rituals. Just then, I noticed my laptop was closed. With a heavy sigh I thought, "She stopped the torrent again, fhoooh". I was surprised to see a nicely folded red color paper, printed with the text "<i>Looking Gorgeous</i>", inside my laptop. Inside the paper was the first clue "<i>Cupboards with empty bottles will quench your thirst</i>". I realized that it was a treasure hunt by my wife, one clue will lead to another and I am sure going to get a treat. I was excited and also confused at the same time. I could not think of any special occasion. I tried hard for a while and proceeded with the treasure hunt.<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
&nbsp;<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Bq9DIwylffI/UjlD0aYoqkI/AAAAAAAAV9E/V4-XL9TCfRY/s1600/DSC09357.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Bq9DIwylffI/UjlD0aYoqkI/AAAAAAAAV9E/V4-XL9TCfRY/s400/DSC09357.JPG" width="400" /></a></div>
<br />
I found the second clue in the kitchen cabinet, third near the washing machine, fourth inside the shoe rack, fifth inside the freezer, sixth in my bike in the parking lot. While running down to the parking lot, I thought "<i>When did she planned all these things?</i>". I came home early last evening, had early dinner and watched the whole movie "Jeans" with her and went to bed. It was a very relaxed evening and I was with her all the time, till we slept. But entire treasure hunt is planned before 5 AM in the morning. She must have done this after I slept. Hmm... <i>How did she guess that I will open the laptop first?</i> - I have no idea. May be she guessed it too. It worked !. I love you pondatti !!!<br />
<br />
The seventh clue was under the kitchen floor mat, eighth clue was with Sruti, sleeping in the second bedroom. I was reluctant to wake her up at that time. But, it was mentioned in the clue and I have to follow it. As soon as I tapped her shoulder, she smiled and gave me the next clue. I knew that she was the partner in crime. The ninth clue under the sofa cushion and the tenth clue was under my wife's pillow. She was asleep. I took the clue carefully without waking her up. The final clue says "<i>Bedroom Attics are not only for Ghosts. Trick or Treat?</i>"<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3Mi7sV3fwXw/UjkjksoD30I/AAAAAAAAV78/gIq7X2O0vC4/s1600/DSC09341.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="300" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-3Mi7sV3fwXw/UjkjksoD30I/AAAAAAAAV78/gIq7X2O0vC4/s400/DSC09341.JPG" width="400" /></a></div>
<br />
You know what?. I did not know the meaning of the word "Attic". I did not know what to do. Google did not struck my mind. I woke up Sruti again and asked her. She explained and went back to bed. I saw a beautifully wrapped gift box with couple of envelopes in the bedrrom attic. <i>Yeahhhh... The hunt is over!.</i> I was about to tear off the gift wrapping and I realized that I do not know the reason still. One of the envelope had another piece of paper which said "<i>Happy 500th Day of Wedding - I Love You</i>". I was smiling, blushing &amp; loving her more than ever. The memories of our dating period flashed in my mind. <i>I love you forever, Pondatti.</i><br />
<br />
The first envelope had the below caption. Only Me &amp; Sangavi know the story behind it. Funny... he he he... Inside was a lovely greeting card. <br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<br />
<br />
The other envelope has couple of other cards with few colored pieces of something. Each piece had a letter painted on it. On closer inspection, I found they were pista shells. I remember last night, Sruti eating a lot of pista and offering me as well. But painting each of the shell would have taken a lot of time. Sruti must have helped Sangavi. Thank you Sruti. :) Hmm... Now I have a tough decision to make. To open the gift or to solve the puzzle. Paused for a while and went on to solve the puzzle first.<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eybrIYyj-fQ/UjlEiCPPZvI/AAAAAAAAV9M/o7jyAkjw5y0/s1600/DSC09358.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-eybrIYyj-fQ/UjlEiCPPZvI/AAAAAAAAV9M/o7jyAkjw5y0/s640/DSC09358.JPG" width="384" /></a></div>
<br />
Each shell is coated with Red, Silver or Bronze color with an English alphabet on it. Both the sides of the shell were painted with different color and different alphabet. One clue says Concave and the other says Convex. I tried to recollect the physics formulae for focal length that I learned in school and later found myself that it denotes the shape of the pista shell. This one must be from Sruti. I know my wife's interest in physics :). Almost after 30 minutes, I solved both the puzzles. <br />

Now to the most awaited gift section. It was exactly what I was planning to get myself sometime in future. It was a smartphone from Micromax, <i>Canvas HD</i> and a Samsung Bluetooth headset. I saw this phone being used by Sounder &amp; Karthiga and they gave me a positive review about this phone. Now, I can take up Udemy classes in the phone anytime, anywhere. Thank you pondatti for a lovely gift :)<br />

We have read business books which talks about starting a business from scratch, may be a step by step advice on what to do and what not to do. Also, we have seen books with the collection of inspiring stories (Ex. <a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2011/11/i-have-dream-book-review.html" target="_blank">I have A Dream</a>, <a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2010/07/connect-dots.html" target="_blank">Connect The Dots</a>) of the successful entrepreneur who created the business out of nothing. There are numerous books which just have the collection of tips, quotes, fiction (Ex. <a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2011/10/trump-way-to-top-best-business-advice-i.html" target="_blank">Trump - The Way To The Top</a>, <a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2010/08/ignore-everybody-and-39-other-keys-to.html" target="_blank">Ignore Everybody</a>, <a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2010/07/leader-who-had-no-title-modern-fable-on.html" target="_blank">The Leader Who Had No Title</a>) etc.,<br />
<br />
This book is different from the other categories. This book is a step-by-step practical guide for anyone with an idea or simply a passion, to create a successful business. Also, the success stories of the successful entrepreneurs are sprinkled all over the book in appropriate places. When you read a topic / idea / plan from this book, there is a corresponding real life success story in the next few pages. The author Chris Guillebeau did collect extensive amount of data and crammed them into this $100 Startup book in a easy fun to read way. He shows that transforming an idea into a successful business is much easier than ever before. He shows us how to test the idea with minimum amount of money before jumping straight into the business.&nbsp; He proves that the money we have is enough and there are no excuses left to start.<br />
<br />
Though there are thousands of thriving successful businesses around the world, for this book Chris considers the businesses that were started with a capital of $100 or less and making a profit of at least $50,000 per year. So, we are not reading about the big corporations, but about the everyday people who identified the opportunity and used it to their sucess. Some entrepreneurs started the business out of curiosity, some started because they hate or did not like the job they were in and some others were forced to start, because they were fired from the job. Whatever the case may be, they are running successful businesses right now across the world.<br />
<br />
Who is this guy Chris Guillebeau?. Seriously I could not pronounce his last name. He is an entrepreneur, traveler and writer. He never had a job and built multiple businesses. He traveled to 175 countries so far (that's 89% countries in this world - Total 196) before the age of 35. He is the author of a best seller book "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0399536108/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=211189&amp;creative=373489&amp;creativeASIN=0399536108&amp;link_code=as3&amp;tag=booiverea-20" target="_blank">The Art of Non-Conformity</a>". This guy knows what he talks about in this book.<br />
<br />
Even if you are not looking to start a business, reading this book may inspire you to do so.You may be surprised at what you can do with the a simple idea or a passion - which you never thought could make you money. I would prefer to keep this book in my reference section and refer to it as and when I need some help. Read it and let me know. Here is the official promo trailer for the book release.<br />

<h2>
What is Dhyanalinga?</h2>
Its a place dedicated for meditation, consecrated by Sadhguru Jaggi Vasudev using Prana Prathishta - a complicated process by which all seven chakras are energised to it's peak and locked inside the structure. It is said that this was the first complete Dhyanalinga in over 2000 years and it's been estimated that the energy will be contained within this structure for at least next 5000 years. This place is located around 30kms from Coimbatore, inside the forest. There are frequent bus/cab services available from Coimbatore.
<br />
<h2>
My Experience with Dhyanalinga</h2>
Since then, I have decided to be open to other's religious / super natural / cult / cosmic being / spiritual beliefs, I've been on many discussions with many of my friends with alternate belief systems. I did not criticize or evaluate their belief system with my rational thinking process, instead I just listened. I got to know so much of information that I did not know before. One such discussion was about people having different experiences with Dhyanalinga's energy. Thanks to Dinesh for providing me the complete picture of the process that was involved in creating this Dhyanalinga. Though I did not understand many of the concpets - I know now, the rough idea behind this structure. I decided to find that out by myself.<br />
<br />
Me, Sangavi, Arthi and three of her friends set out to Dhyanalinga in a car and a bike. The route to this place was really lovely with green trees/vegetation on both sides. We reached the place in mid noon with scorching sun above our head. This place has to maintained in complete silence. So they collected the cameras, cellphones other items in the entrance itself. It's free.I have used the pictures I got from Internet on this blog to give you a visual experience.<br />
<br />
You are welcomed and greeted by the volunteers. If you are the first 
time visitor to Dhyanalinga, you will be shown a small documentary movie
 about Dhyanalinga. I would suggest you to watch it.

Next is to have a dip in the holy pond to energize yourself and to dissipate the heat. You need to shower yourself before getting into the pond. They will provide you with saffron color towel. You are suppose to remove all the clothing and wear only this towel. They charge Rs. 20 for each person. <br />
<br />
The pond called "<b>Surya Kund</b>" is constructed 30 feet below the ground level. The depth of the water is 5 feet. This pond has three consecrated Lingams and an artificial water fall. You are suppose to walk slowly into the pond, touch the Lingam with both your hands and take a dip in the water. The water is so chill and so clear - I could see the toes, nails on my feet. It was as if I am watching through a magnifying glass. Once you take the dip - your body is cooled down immediately with the cold water. This is a surreal experience. I thought this experience is worth the visit to Dhyanalinga.<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pIFy_9SaGGY/UiWFf6J7d9I/AAAAAAAAVpo/9cVgb0SsGIM/s1600/dhyanalinga_theerthakund5.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="212" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-pIFy_9SaGGY/UiWFf6J7d9I/AAAAAAAAVpo/9cVgb0SsGIM/s320/dhyanalinga_theerthakund5.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>
I walked though the pond slowly, touching the Lingams, taking dips in water, standing in the waterfall. <i>I did not feel anything spiritual - but it was a lovely experience</i>. <i>I did not feel any sort of energy passing through me.</i><br />
<br />
This above place is only for Men. There is a separate pond called <b>Chandra Kund</b> which is reserved for women visiting Dhyanalinga.<br />
<br />
I strongly suggest you to take a dip, whether you are religious or not. Its a lovely experience.<br />
<br />
<h2>
Linga Bhairavi Temple</h2>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WtkOBiPe0Xc/UiWINQWv4HI/AAAAAAAAVp0/HjYu-PS5RIo/s1600/Sadhguru-Mystic-sub-LingaBhairavi-4.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="213" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-WtkOBiPe0Xc/UiWINQWv4HI/AAAAAAAAVp0/HjYu-PS5RIo/s320/Sadhguru-Mystic-sub-LingaBhairavi-4.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>
There are volunteers everywhere to guide you to the places and to answer your questions. The old volunteer in front of this temple, explained that this is the feminine form of Lingam. You can worship Linga Bhairavi as you would do to other Hindu gods. There are requests made to her, in exchange for flowers and poojas. A typical Hindu establishment. I seriously do not see a need for this temple inside a meditation place.<br />
<br />
I saw a lot of foreigners in saffron dresses doing poojas, offering flowers, doing meditations etc. A typical scene in any Ashram. She offered me Neem Leaves and Lilly flowers inside the temple. I was suppose to eat the Neem Leaves. It was the bitter than the Bitter Gourd. Luckily they sold "<i>Pasiparuppu Payasam</i>" just outside the temple for Rs. 10. With the help of the payasam, I could eat three neem leaves. Even though we knew the benefits of Neem leaves, this is my first successful attempt in eating them. I was proud !. 
<br />
<h2>
Nandhi</h2>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N6JSOA5sxsQ/UiaQukHxKUI/AAAAAAAAVqE/CJEvBDjdO5o/s1600/Dhyanalinga-Nandi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: right; float: right; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-left: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-N6JSOA5sxsQ/UiaQukHxKUI/AAAAAAAAVqE/CJEvBDjdO5o/s320/Dhyanalinga-Nandi.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>
We saw a small beautiful artificial pond with Lillies and Goldfishes, on the way to Dhyanalinga and spent some time walking around the pond, watching the flowers and fishes. It was good. A big 15 foot Nandi interrupted us on Dhyanalinga's entrance. Its made up of a metal alloy, filled with herbs inside, consecrated by a ceremony. It was painted in pitch black color and looks majestic than the Charging Bull in front of Newyork Stock Exchange.We were not allowed to touch or climb the Nandhi.<br />
<br />
<h2>
Sarva Tharma Sthamba
</h2>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_pE8BiHZaVA/UiaVCvIdgeI/AAAAAAAAVqQ/7NFtFcHa2Js/s1600/Dhyanalinga_Sarva_Dharma_Sthamba.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-_pE8BiHZaVA/UiaVCvIdgeI/AAAAAAAAVqQ/7NFtFcHa2Js/s320/Dhyanalinga_Sarva_Dharma_Sthamba.JPG" width="320" /></a></div>
We saw "<i>Sarva Tharma Sthamba</i>", just before the entrance, signifying singularity or union of all religions. This stone has the inscriptions of symbols of Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, Jainism, Taoism, Zoroastrianism, Judaism, Buddhism, and Shinto welcoming people from all religious beliefs. I am not sure how many people actually notice this Sthamba. I did not see a single person looking or checking this out. May be this should be placed in a more strategical place or should be made more attractive - to convey the message.
<br />
<h2>
Dhyanalinga</h2>
Finally we are into Dhyanalinga. The side walls on the path to Dhyanalinga has stone sculptures depicting many scenes in Hindu mythologies. This is not congruent with the Sarva Tharma Sthamba we saw outside. The volunteers allow people to go inside Dhyanalinga in batches, every five minutes. There are 27 enclosures on the side walls of Dhyanalinga. You can either sit inside the enclosures or in the open space for meditation. The five minute time is for the people who just came to visit. If you want to meditate longer, you can do it. No one will disturb your meditation. <br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JkO0z9yhas4/UiaX365GWXI/AAAAAAAAVqc/ZgaKwmom_Yg/s1600/dhyanalinga-temple.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-JkO0z9yhas4/UiaX365GWXI/AAAAAAAAVqc/ZgaKwmom_Yg/s1600/dhyanalinga-temple.jpg" /></a></div>
<br />
I was surprised to see the pillar-less construction of such a big dome. My surprise increased thousand times, when I heard that this was constructed with out Steel &amp; Concrete. This was built with the ancient Indian technique with brick, mud, lime, clay and some herbs. It is properly ventilated and illuminated - perfect for meditation. It is said that this structure will withstand for at least 5000 years. There was such a silence inside Dhyanalinga where I could hear my wife's earring swinging. It was very serene.<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<span style="color: blue;">"Just sitting silently for a few minutes within the sphere of 
Dhyanalinga is enough to make even those unaware of meditation 
experience a state of deep meditativeness." - Sadhguru</span></blockquote>
I occupied one of enclosures and started to meditate. I expected some sort of energy to flow through me or a sudden relaxation or calmness in the body and mind, as it happened to many others. But nothing happened. I actually slept. I woke up when I heard the sound of&nbsp; people walking out for the next batch. That was a big disappointment for me. I came to Dhyanalinga with an open mind to experience it. The above statement by Sadhguru is not true in all cases. But, I heard from my close friend that he felt the energy (he never lies for anything in life). So, I can conclude that the above statement may be true for few people (may be religious?). Objective failed, but the experiment was success. I enjoyed the trip to Dhyanalinga.
<br />
<h2>
Why should You visit Dhyanalinga?</h2>
<ol>
<li>The architecture and construction techniques is nothing short of any other marvelous constructions in the world. It's a must see, if you like to travel.</li>
<li>The refreshingly chill holy dip in Surya Kund. This is the best and I loved it.</li>
<li>The biggest meditation place in the world, situated inside the forest. If you are interested in meditation, then this is your Mecca.</li>
<li>You can book in advance and stay in the Dhyanalinga premises for several courses on yoga, meditation and mindful living.</li>
</ol>
Though I did not experience what I wanted to experience, I will try once more. Next time, I am planning to stay in Dhyanalinga for a week or two to learn yoga, meditation etc., May be I will experience something new or never. Who knows !<br />

<b>5 AM Club</b> - Robin Sharma mentions the importance of rising early in almost all of his books/speeches/blog etc. I tried to join the 5 AM club before with little success. I was very inconsistent and eventually stopped it. Steve Pavlina suggested a simple but powerful tip in this blog post "<a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/05/how-to-become-an-early-riser/" target="_blank">How to Become an Early Riser</a>", which helped me to wake up at 6 AM daily for about 6 months, until I came back to India.<br />
<br />
<b>Early Rising Tip:</b>&nbsp;Go to bed when You're sleepy (and only when you're sleepy) and get up with an alarm clock at a fixed time (7 days per week). The catch is - irrespective of when you go to bed, you always wake up at a fixed time. No excuses. The first few days will be tough and you may feel tired throughout the waking hours. Once your brain realizes that there will be no sleep after the fixed time, it will push you to sleep early. The natural cycle for sleep will set in. I had 100% success with this technique.<br />
<br />
<b>48 Day Challenge:</b> Starting today, I am going to wake up at 5 AM daily (irrespective of weekends, travels, party, night outs). Why 48 days?. It counts to one Mandalam. Though there are religious interpretation/usage of Mandalam for doing poojas, it was originally developed by Siddhars as a measure of time for medication. If you do any specific task at a specific time consistently for 48 days, it becomes a habit. So, I choose to wake up daily at 5 AM for 48 days - to make this a permanent habit for me. If I miss a day, I will restart from Day 1.<br />
<br />
PS: You may see many references in internet that 21 days is enough to forge a habit. Since, I am going to do this for the rest of my life, I chose 48 days for my experiment.<br />
<br />
<b>What to do with the extra hours?</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It's not the waking up time that makes you successful, but what you do in those extra hours does. So, We need a plan to utilize those extra hours to work towards your goals or passion or health or acquiring more knowledge or improving meditation skills etc. Here is what I planned for the extra hours.<br />
<br />
<i><span style="color: blue;"><b>My Morning List:</b></span></i><br />
<i><span style="color: blue;"><b><br /></b></span></i>
0. Wake up at 5 AM<br />
1. Brush the teeth and empty the bowels.<br />
2. Drink one liter of water.<br />
3. Meditate for 30 mins (I wanted to meditate for many many years)<br />
4. <a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2011/09/eft-manual-book-review.html" target="_blank">Emotional Freedom Technique</a> with the <a href="http://www.newthoughtfamilies.com/Books/FreeEBooks/TheMagicofChoicesinEFT.pdf" target="_blank">Choices Method</a> for 30 mins (I really want to test this on myself)<br />
5. Read a book or Listen to an audio book or Write a blog post<br />
6. Work on any personal projects, either technical or personal development.<br />
<br />
This is not a final list of tasks. I will keep changing the tasks or reorganize it as per my needs in course of time. I decided to spend 2 hrs compulsory for myself in the morning and additional time as the day permits. You can prepare your own list. If lists overwhelm you, just do one simple thing like, listen to soothing music, learn an art, go to gym, learn yoga, learn meditation, watch the sunrise, go for a walk in the beach, walk in the grass in bare foot, write a poem etc., - Do whatever that makes you happy, as the first thing in the morning. Get it?<br />
<br />
<b>What NOT to do?</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; We humans tend to drift away from our goals every now and then, right. I do. So, I need to have a Not-To-Do list as well, to keep me focused on my To-Do list.<br />
<br />
- Do not Snooze or Sleep.<br />
- Do not check Facebook for the first 2 hours.<br />
<br />
I may find some other distractions to my To-Do list in the coming 48 days. I will add them to the Not-To-Do list and keep focus on my goals.<br />
<br />
<b>Why this experiment?</b> I am beginning to feel contentment with myself, happy with my life (Thanks to Sangavi). A thought of unknown origin tells me - It's time to give back. But, I don't know what to give or how to give. I am searching for a meaning for my life, even though my conscious atheist self says that there is no meaning. I want to organize my lifestyle and channel my energy in proper ways, so I may find many excellent &amp; exciting ideas / opportunities that my entire life would not be enough to complete them. Feeling excited as I write this.<br />
<br />
PS: Today I woke up at 4.47 AM and did tasks 0 - 5 :)<br />
<br />
<span style="color: blue;"><b>Would you be interested to take up this challenge?. What are the tasks in your morning list?. I am curious to know. Please let me know in the comments.</b></span>

25th August 2012 - Some seemingly very unimportant event happened in my life. I couldn't tie my shoe laces while sitting in a chair. I was huffing &amp; puffing when I am done. Yeah. I had a big belly. I could not believe the condition of my physique. I started thinking. Just like the butterfly effect in Chaos Theory, this event triggered a series of events in my life, which led me to change my lifestyle drastically. I started doing one little thing at a time. Below are the list of changes that I attempted from last year.<br />

<br />
The last change - going raw vegan was very drastic and very very effective. I was a voracious meat eater. Switching immediately to the opposite side of the spectrum would be very tough. So, I did stop eating meat from Jan 1, 2013. After a month, I started eating raw vegan food for the breakfast for two weeks, then two weeks for the dinner and eventually for all three meals in the day. From 1st March 2013, I was on 100% raw vegan diet. After being in this diet for 5 months, you can see the results in the above picture.<br />
<br />
<i>How does that feel?. Good or Bad?</i><br />
<br />
<b>Physique:</b> The first noticeable change was in my physique. I lost almost all of the extra fat from my body and I did lose few pounds of lean muscle as well. It felt amazing when I lost few inches off my waist. My body felt very light, I could walk fast, climb up stairs with ease. Before this diet, while on streets, I use to tuck in my stomach or hold my breath to make my chest look bigger - when I see a beautiful girl on the other side or a man bigger than me. That became my nature that I do it unconsciously. After being a raw vegan, I don't have any issues with my body and don't do any of those acts in public. I lost 20 kgs in 5 months.<br />
<br />
<b>Health:</b> I was never sick in the past 15 years, even when I was overweight. I was not sick during the last five months as well. So, I am not sure, if raw vegan diet helped improve my health or not. With the kind of information available in the internet and the research books that I read, it is definitely healthy. If you are not healthy, it will improve. By health - I meant the state of all the internal organs, which is not obvious to us, until something goes wrong.<br />
<br />
<b>Cognizance:</b> I am not sure how to explain this in words. While on vegan diet, I don't have the fogginess in my thinking. I was able to think more clearly and able to communicate that with friends more precisely. I never stumbled for words. They flow freely. I started writing more and reading more. I started spending more time for myself - to improve myself. I invested in lot of audio books and made it a habit to listen to them daily. Started exploring the other side of my life (giving back to the society). Basically I would say that I am a much different person now. I can spend time alone and be happy &amp; content. I don't have any specific proof to say that Raw Vegan Diet did this, but my instinct says it did.<br />
<br />
<b>Food Carving:</b> When I completed the 5 months trial, I thought I would be carving for cooked food. But that was not the case. The cooked food did taste better than raw vegan diet, especially my wife's cooking. I liked eating cooked food, but I don't carve for cooked food. Once when my wife was not around, by default - without thinking, I reached out for raw vegan breakfast. I don't know, if this is some sort of contentment/detachment with food, but definitely better. During my college days (when going out with friends - mostly parting), I will come home around 1 AM in the midnight and my mom use to prepare fresh food at that time and feed me. Otherwise, I will not eat. Thinking about that with now.<br />
<br />
<b>Social Pressure:</b> This is the toughest part of the raw vegan diet. We do have a lot of friends and relatives in India. Once or twice in a month, we have to attend some functions (marriage, baby shower, birthday celebrations, etc.) and you will have to eat in all the functions. Not eating in those functions is disrespecting the host. I have to come up with excuses or take the host in private and explain them about my diet. Trust me, nobody understands. All of them told me this, "<i>Eat this one time, you continue from tomorrow. Today is special</i>". Saying NO to the love of your loved ones is the toughest part of this diet. Another part of the story is that - when relatives visit home and they see me slim, there will be hundreds of questions to Sangavi. All of them were elders and respectable persons in the family and the society. Those were the tough times for her as well. She persisted those times with a smile for me.<br />
<br />
This is a problem specific to India and surrounding countries with related culture. So, does not apply for all.<br />
<br />
<b>Self-Confidence:</b> Especially when you know that you can do something which 99% of the people around you cannot do, your self confidence soars to the high sky. Overcoming social pressure is the next plateau for your self confidence. You will know you can do things even if the whole world is against your idea. This raw vegan diet brought me self control, reduced procrastination, improved my self confidence greatly. Following Raw Vegan Diet equals reading hundreds of self developments books. Seriously. Trust me.<br />
<br />
Some of the raw vegan recipes that I prepared and enjoyed are in my <a href="http://www.raw-vegan-recipes.com/" target="_blank">raw-vegan-recipes blog</a>. Read and Enjoy !<br />
<br />
<b>Was the experiment successful? </b><br />
<br />
I do have a lot of obese/overweight friends who complain about the impossibility of losing weight. The whole idea behind this experiment is to find a reliable and healthy mean to lose weight and when I lose weight, my friends will get inspired. I did lose weight. Very funny thing is that, my friends still complains about overweight and ignored me and my diet plan as "<i>Outcasts</i>". I am no longer an ordinary human being with an ordinary appetite. I laughed at myself. Nevertheless, I was blogging the efforts along the way. If it inspires one person in the world, I would consider my experiment a successful one. I don't know at this point. The comments in this blog may help establish it.<br />
<br />
<b>What's Next?</b><br />
<br />
<i><b>Gain muscle !</b></i>. Yeah. right. I do know many skinny persons in the world. I am going to show them how to gain muscle mass and retain it in a healthy way. I am going to make it as simple as I could. If you would like to follow along, please subscribe (look for gadgets in right side of this blog) for the blog posts. All the best !.<br />

This is not a complete book, but a booklet. With this content, the author could have easily expanded into hundreds of pages. But, he wanted to make his point precisely in a short text - The Power of Thoughts. This is a much written upon subject in the market now. We could easily find hundreds of good books and thousands of junk books on this subject. This book, by James Allen is the pioneer to all of them. Even after so many decades this book is still being studied by most of the personal development gurus around the world. This book is being recommended again and again by many of my favorite authors.<br />
<br />
This book is not under copyright law. The eBook / Audio book versions are available for free in the internet. Feel free to pick up the version that suits you and spend roughly 30 mins to read or 45 mins to listen. Trust me, you won't regret it - if you read it with open mind. Yeah. That's gonna be tough for many people with preconceived idea about life. If you find yourself in that situation where you could not appreciate or understand the concepts discussed in this booklet, please read this book again in a month or after six months. But, please keep reading until you get the message in to your mind.<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
"A man is literally what he thinks" - his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts.</blockquote>
Everything that you see in the world was once a thought in someone's mind. Persisted thoughts coupled with actions, manifests itself in the real world. I can understand this from a scientist/engineer's perspective - You have a concept for a product or a structure in mind, work towards it, until it becomes a reality. Simple. But, James Allen claims more than that. Any man's current situation, being happy or unhappy, being rich or poor, his external circumstances that he can control or out of his control - were the direct results of the the thoughts harbored in his mind. He claims that we could control our inner character and the outer circumstances by thinking right thoughts and eliminating wrong thoughts.<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
"Blessedness; not material possessions, is the measure of right thoughts; wretchedness, not lack of material possessions, is the measure of wrong thoughts."</blockquote>
Like a gardener protecting his plants from weeds, we must continuously monitor and protect ourselves from wrong thoughts. He explains this with the examples of rich and poor, oppressed and the oppressors etc. He goes on to explain how thoughts affect our health and the body and the importance of having good thoughts. He also stresses the importance of having a purpose to fill your mind with the good thoughts about achieving that purpose. Even if you don't believe in Life's Purpose concept, he urges us to do whatever we do in a perfect faultless manner. Make that as a point to gather your thoughts.<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
"Until thought is linked with purpose, there is no intelligent accomplishment"</blockquote>
This book is clear on the concept that it tries to teach, but lacks the "how to" portion of it. James Allen says "Aimlessness is vice", to a world where most of the people do not know what they want. He does not give the instructions to conceive a purpose or to maintain good thoughts in minds. I think, if he had included those instructions in his book or at least give a pointer to those instructions, this would be a one stop book for all your personal development needs. There is no such thing right?.<br />
