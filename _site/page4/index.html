Funny. Isn't it?. Yeah. "Before &amp; After marriage" is just for fun.&nbsp;The idea is the transformation of my body within few months after coming to UK.&nbsp;The first picture was taken on June 2, 2011 in Los Angeles and the second one on Aug 22, 2012 in London. I did not go to gym from July 2011&nbsp;onward, my food habits did not change very much and I retained the same body structure till mid 2012. I am officially into the "<i>Overweight</i>" category as of August 22, 2012. I believe, I was in this category for quite some time and I did not realize it. Weighing 80&nbsp;kg&nbsp;&nbsp;at 5 feet 6 inches&nbsp;in my 29th year, pushed my BMI to 28.34. Within few months, I may move into the Obese category if I do not act now.</div>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
My body transformation is due to the same old reasons. <i>Sedentary lifestyle and consumption of excessive calories</i>. What was changed in my diet?. hmm...&nbsp;<i>Muffins... Muffins... Muaaahhh...</i> Yeah, I begin to eat muffins everyday, after coming to UK... Thanks to my wife. (She eats as much as I do and surprisingly she remains slim). I would say, "<i>A muffin a day, keeps your six packs away</i>".&nbsp;</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
For me to get back to old shape is pretty easy. I am very much used to controlling the diet and regular workouts. I can get back to that shape in 3 months time. (<i>Any one willing to bet a million pounds on this?</i>). But, I am not going to do that. When I was in perfect shape, I use to advice my overweight/obese friends on diets and workouts. Few attempted, but none of them followed through. What was holding them?. I think, I know a little bit now. We don't consider our body as a gift, but an excess luggage.&nbsp;We begin to detach ourselves from our body and in extreme cases, we hate our body.&nbsp;Our mind prefers to do other seemingly important tasks than paying attention to the body needs.&nbsp;With this mindset, it's extremely difficult for the overweight/obese people to hit the gym everyday. That's fair. Yeah.</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
The point is... <i>Building the perfect physique</i> is not that tough and hard. I use to hear a lot of simple techniques to lose weight from my friends, relatives, internet etc... I never attempted to try any of them other than the tough workouts. This time, its going to be different. I am going to choose few of these tips and try them one at a time. The only filtering criteria is, "<i>It should be simple and should not demand a drastic change in lifestyle</i>". However, I see those simple changes as simple lifestyle changes. Eventually our lifestyle and habit changes to a certain point that being overweight/obese is something that you cannot even think of or you would laugh at it. Yeah. that's the goal.</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
What are all the tips that I am going to try?. I do not know at this point. I am gonna research and use my body as a guinea pig for all those experiments. I don't want to walk this journey alone. I prefer company. If you are overweight/obese or just want to shed few pounds off or just to keep yourself fit, you can follow me in this journey. I will try to blog as much as I can about the experiments and post the results as well. This is not a <i>Six-Packs-In-Six-Weeks</i> program. This is a slow journey. I cannot guarantee you results. It depends on the individuals. You may see results or may not. You are responsible for all your actions. Please check with your doctor, before attempting any of the experiments that I am going to blog about.&nbsp;</div>

<b>Book: On Desire:</b> Why We Want What We Want<br />
<b>Author:</b> William B. Irvine<br />

<br />
We all have desires. Isn't it?. I desire everything that attracts me. If I like an activity, I want to do it. If I like a &nbsp;product, I want to have it. If I like a person, I want to have a relationship with him/her. I believe, many are like me. Ever wondered, Why do we have desire to do anything at all?. What triggers these desires?. Why some desires are stronger than others?. Why do people even risk their life for love, power or money?. This book has answers for these questions, in a way that is tough to digest.<br />
<br />
The author William Irvine is a professor of Philosophy at Wright State University. This book shows his rich experience in philosophy. He is able to take us from the ground level to the level where we can understand what he has to say. All his discussions are based on philosophy, reasoning, Darwinism and a lot of scientific evidences. He starts the book with the basic discussions on desire and moves on to the science and evolution of desire and finishes the book with the dealing of desires. He uses a lot of examples to explain each and every concept clearly.<br />
<br />
One such example: If I am hungry, I will find the keys, start the car, drive to the nearest restaurant, eat anything that is available and end my hunger pangs. A very ordinary, day to day activity for many people.<br />
<br />
You are hungry and you need to end your hunger pangs. To accomplish that, you find the car key and drive to the restaurant. If you are not hungry, you would not have driven to the restaurant. The anxiety to end the hunger pangs is called <b>Terminal Desire&nbsp;</b>(wanted for its own sake). The other desires that you form to accomplish your terminal desire are called <b>Instrumental Desires</b><b>.</b><br />
<br />
Most of our terminal desires are formed by our emotions and all of our instrumental desires are formed by our intellect. Surprisingly, emotions win over intellect most of the time (unless you are enlightened). Most of our terminal desires are the results of thousands of years of evolution. Irvine discusses the possibility of the evolution of desires in species and its part in helping the species to survive and reproduce.<br />
<br />
For example, if having sex hurts you badly and jumping into fire produces orgasm, all of us would have perished long back. What makes sex, a desirable thing to do and jumping into fire a strict non-desirable thing to do?. Only Darwinism can answer that question. The ultimate goal of any species is to survive and reproduce. All the desires that helps to achieve these goals are desirable and others non-desirable. All of these information are already coded into our DNA, which Irvine calls <b>Biological Incentive System (BIS)</b><br />
<br />
BIS rewards you with orgasm, if you have sex (helps reproduction) and punishes you for jumping into fire (does not help survival). BIS decides most of what we want. You get a perception that what you <b>will</b> want is already decided by your BIS. Where does the free will go?. The idea of free will is an illusion, when compared to the grand scale desires we form.We have free will to decide the Instrumental Desires, but not the Terminal desires. In most cases, instrumental desires are formed to accomplish Terminal Desires.<br />
<br />
For example, if you do not like Brinjal (Egg Plant), you can choose not to eat it. You have free will. Great. But, your BIS decides that you do not like Brinjal (Terminal Desire) and your choice of not eating it (Instrumental Desire), is just to accomplish your Terminal Desire. You may try to prove that you have free will, by forcing yourself &nbsp;to eat Brinjal. But, it wont be an enjoyable experience like sex, that you want to do again and again. With me, huh?<br />
<br />
We are not just slaves to our BIS (doing so, ensures our survival). We can, to some extent control our BIS. He discusses the various approaches, involving philosophical practices, religious practices etc. Some of the religious practices are interesting to know. Old Order Amish's submission to higher authority, Hutterites reluctance to progress and Shakers remarkable celibacy (no sex). Most of these communal groups try to suppress almost all of their basic desires for a&nbsp;rewarding&nbsp;after life. So, does the&nbsp;Christians&nbsp;and&nbsp;Buddhists&nbsp;to some extent. I actually enjoyed reading this chapter more than the other chapters.Thank you Irvine, for this book.<br />
<br />
This book will have an impact on all things that you see, do and feel. This will radically change your perception on everything. This is not just another philosophical book. This book might save a lot of your time in chasing the desires that may not be relevant to what you are. Please do read. <br />
<br />
If you get a different perception after reading this book, please let me know in the comments section.<br />

<br />
“As long as you have your eyes on the goal, you don’t see obstacles”. These are the very opening words of the book ‘You can sell’ by Shiv Khera. For a person who is passionate about marketing (of course, me!) this book came as a juicy piece of cake to read and review. What better can I ask for? So, here is the review for the book ‘You can sell’.<br />
<br />
Right in the preface Mr. Khera tells what kind of book this is and for whom it is. I would strongly recommend following his instructions in the preface, for that is the best way to read this book. This isn’t a novel which can be read on the go or taken for light reading just like that. Do not expect to read this book for passing time. Please do have a highlighter and a pen throughout the reading, as there are many points which you might need to highlight for future reference. Pen is for the exercise at the end of every chapter. What a way to reinforce the thoughts in the chapter in the minds of readers! The work book ranges from personal SWOT analysis to a few psychometric tests to explaining the points read in the previous chapter.<br />
<br />
Mr. Khera has artfully structured the book knowing which chapter to place after which chapter. It flows sinuously from one chapter to another without difficulty. No cuts and breaks in between. He has gone to a great detail to mention even the little nuances and discuss about them and their importance. Highlighting of punch lines gets the immediate attention and conveys the message in a nutshell. Adding his personal experiences and who’s ever possible makes the principles look very viable and not impractical to implement.<br />
<br />
Though this is a domain based book, the terms and language used are very simple and even a layman could pick this book and understand what is given. And for those who are in the field of selling or who aspire to be this field, this book shall be a pole star to guide you. Of course, at the end of the day it all zeroes on you. Nobody can induce principles and ideas in you. You are the one who understand, internalize and put those principles and ideas into practice.<br />
<br />
Who is not a salesperson? Anyone who markets himself or his idea or a product or anything for that matter is a salesperson. So, a doctor, a lawyer, an engineer, a politician, a college student and everyone else becomes a salesperson at some point of time. So, you can’t confine this book as a selling practice domain book. It is useful for everyone.&nbsp; Mr. Khera doesn’t feed you with fish for hunger but teaches how to fish.<br />
<br />
These are a few points which I found as the heights of selling insight:</div>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Leadership is not a popularity contest.</li>
<li>A good professional only learns the trade not tricks.</li>
<li>Selling is nothing but transfer of enthusiasm</li>
<li>Winners compete with themselves; they better their own record constantly</li>
<li>Losers do not like to get up in the morning, winners don’t like to get up in the morning either, but they get up anyways.</li>
<li>When a sales person realizes that the profession is not only about making sales, but involves helping others and solving problems, he becomes a professional.</li>
</ul>
<div>
Though I’m generally not in favor of self-help books there are always exceptions. This book is one such exception. I never found this book manipulative or misleading. It just states the facts and principles for a good salesperson. I would recommend this book to every salesperson and even to those who have taken marketing as a subject in MBA or in any equivalent course.<br />

<br />
Generally, I do not prefer Gold, in fact my engagement ring is the first gold ornament in my body.&nbsp;It's a custom in India&nbsp;for the bride &amp; groom&nbsp;to wear Gold Jewels during wedding.&nbsp;I had no options but to buy. I head out to "Joy Alukkas". I was discussing about the Gold Jewellery Business in India, with the floor manager and I am surprised to know that majority of the people does not even understand the basics. In fact, my parents were cheated by "L.K.S&nbsp;Jewellers" when they bought 916 KDM Gold Rings few years back. So, this blog may be a beginner's first hand information, when you buy Gold Jewels in India.<br />
<br />
<i>I would like to explain few technical&nbsp;jargon&nbsp;related to Gold Jewels...</i><br />
<br />
<b>Carat (K):</b> Its the unit of purity of gold. As per the calculation below, 24K Gold is nearly 99.9% pure gold.&nbsp;24K Gold is suggested for Golden Ornaments of more than 10&nbsp;<i>Sovereigns </i>and remember there is no&nbsp;guarantee&nbsp;for the Jewels, since they may lose the shape even with&nbsp;normal&nbsp;usage.<br />

<b>916 KDM (or) 22K Gold:</b>&nbsp;Most of the Gold Jewels made in India are of 22K Gold.&nbsp;Cadmium or Kadium (KDM) use to be one of the metal mixed with Gold&nbsp;to make it strong, so that beautiful intricate designs can be made. Cadmium is safe in the finished gold products, but very dangerous in the manufacturing process. Some countries banned Cadmium to be used in gold ornaments. In that case, the alloy would be the combination of Silver, Copper and Zinc. (The % of these metals varies, depends on the manufacturer). 916 KDM Gold is a gold alloy of Gold and (Silver + Copper + Zinc) with roughly 91.6% of pure gold which is 22K Gold. Though we do not use Cadmium in most cases, we still use the name KDM. Look at the below calculation.<br />

<b>18K Gold:</b> 18K Gold is 75% of pure Gold and 25% of other metals. Using the above formula, you can decide the percentage of pure gold in your gold ornaments.<br />
<br />
<b>BIS Hallmark: </b>The Government of India formed Bureau of Indian Standards (BIS) in the year 1987, which is the only&nbsp;institution&nbsp;in India, authorised to hallmark golden Jewellery. The Jewellers has to obtain a licence from BIS for a fee and hallmark the jewel they make with BIS logo.&nbsp;BIS maintains market surveillance on the certified jewellers, on random basis. Market surveillance involves collection of Hallmarked Gold Jewellary from licencee's retail outlet/manufacturing premises and having it tested for conformity in BIS recognized hallmarking centre.&nbsp;Deviations in degree of purity of gold and operation not in conformance to the system may result in cancellation of BIS licence.<br />

<br />
Most of the&nbsp;Gold Smiths&nbsp;print the word "916" or "916 KDM" on the Jewels without the logo. Many jewellers will show you these printed numbers and claim that they are 916 KDM Jewels. Do not listen to the jewellers. Just look for the above logo. If you do not find the logo in the Jewels, it means that the specific Jewel is NOT verified for the purity of gold and you are being cheated.&nbsp;<i style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">Please purchase the Gold Ornaments, ONLY if it is hallmarked with BIS logo.</i><span style="color: red;">&nbsp;</span><br />
<br />
<b>Sovereign: </b>It is actually a gold coin of United Kingdom issued way back in 1817, which is valued roughly at one Pound Sterling. The weight of the gold coin is roughly 7.988052 grams. Even after British left India, we still use the term "Sovereign" as a unit to measure gold jewellery.<br />
<br />
1 Sovereign = 8 grams of Gold.<br />
<br />
<b>Wastage Charges:</b> When the Gold Smith makes the gold jewel, it is assumed that some portion of the gold is wasted. Technically he recovers everything from the chemicals, the "assumed wastage" of gold is charged to the customers.<br />
<br />
<b>Making Charges:</b> The charges you pay to the Gold Smith to make the Jewel out of raw gold.<br />
<br />
<b>Hallmarking Charges:</b>&nbsp;BIS certified Assaying and Hallmarking centers hallmarks the gold for Rs.25 per gold ornament. (As of August 1st, 2012). <i>You don't need to pay that amount. </i>It should already be covered in any of the charges above. If you are being asked to pay more than Rs. 25, please tell the Jewellers that you would pay the amount, but would need the bill to&nbsp;explicitly&nbsp;mention the BIS hallmarking charges and the Assaying center's name and address and you would register a complaint with BIS for this.<br />
<br />
<b>What percentage you can give?.</b> Now a days, the Jewellers combine both the charges into one, (either wastage or making charges) so that you feel you are being charged less. Just a&nbsp;psychological effect. With the information collected from my friends in Bangalore, Chennai and other parts of Tamil Nadu, I can conclude that&nbsp;the combined charges&nbsp;of ...<br />
<br />
Less than 8% -- You are brilliant in negotiation. Please teach me the tricks!<br />
8% - 10% -- Average.<br />
10% - 13% -- The maximum you should give, however complicate the design is.<br />
More than 13% -- You are being cheated.<br />
<br />
It was like this, when we bought "<i>Thali Kodi</i>" for my wife and a "<i>Short Chain</i>" for me. I saved my hard earned money of Rs. 3,816 from the Jewellers.<br />

<i><br /></i><br />
<i>Remember the below:</i><br />
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li>No one does business for loss or charity.</li>
<li>Never feel shy to negotiate for Gold. Its your money. Even after you negotiated for a good %, you could as for a flat discount.</li>
<li>The Jewellers are already millionaires. By paying them more "free money" you are making them rich. In turn they will open more Showrooms. Who benefits?. Think!. Definitely, you lose.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Instead, you could bargain &amp; donate the money to your favorite charity. Society benefits !.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<b>While Exchanging Gold :&nbsp;</b>We decided to exchange the unused rings and bangles for the new gold.&nbsp;Joy Alukkas charged 1% of <i>melting / usage charges</i> (?) on the gold while exchanging. I was surprised. I argued with them that these are KDM jewels and I won't pay a single paise. The manager told that he would accept the jewels from Joy Alukkas without melting charges, but not from other jewellers. Ater negotiating for few more minutes, he agreed to take the gold for exchange without any charges.<br />
<br />
<i>Things to remember while exchanging gold...</i><br />
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li>Never pay a single paise for melting charges / usage charges or whatever charge they impose.</li>
<li>The Gold must be exchanged for the current gold price. Never accept any price lesser than that.</li>
<li>If you are in a hurry and they do not reduce, please ask them a letter mentioning the charges that you are paying for exchanging the gold and tell them that you will take that up with BIS.</li>
<li>If you are not in a hurry, move on to the next shop.</li>
</ol>
Once this is settled, another surprise was waiting for me. One of the Golden Ring (1 Sovereign) that my dad purchased from L.K.S Jewellers many years ago, with the printed word "916 KDM" failed in the purity test. It had only 80% gold and the rest was mixed with Silver!. This jewel is from one of established Jewellers in Chennai. Hard to believe right?. Joy Alukkas melted the ring and showed the proof in the purity meter. Here is the picture.<br />
<br />

<br />
My Dad used to buy most of the jewellery from one of the showrooms of L.K.S Jewellery, since it was close to our house. My dad trusted the jewellery shop so much that every single jewel in our house is from that shop.&nbsp;But, <b>L.K.S Jewellers cheated my dad and lost a loyal customer.&nbsp;</b><br />
<br />
Many people that I know, would bargain with street vendors, fish markets etc for few rupees, but reluctant to bargain in a Jewellery shop. My mom is one of them. Why is that?. Couple of reasons, that I came to know.<br />
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li>Ego. You feel small, when you are negotiating in a jewellery shop. You don't want others to think that you do not have enough money or you are a miser. Just a self thought by few people.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Arguing / negotiating reduces the value of the occasion (wedding or valentine's day gift etc). If you buy the gold at the said price without negotiation, you value the occasion more than the money. You feel great. Crap!. Isn't it?. But, it is a true for few people that I know. When you buy the items like "Thali Kodi" or idol of any god, many jewellers advise you not to argue and surprisingly, people listen.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HSmfmrHDZM4/UNbg2eENUBI/AAAAAAAAVH4/OM0jevLZAEE/s1600/human-mind-thinking.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HSmfmrHDZM4/UNbg2eENUBI/AAAAAAAAVH4/OM0jevLZAEE/s320/human-mind-thinking.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>
<br />
I have been thinking about this concept of running a software program without any hardware for quite some time. I know what you are thinking. Let's stop the rational thinking about the possibilities of its&nbsp;implementation. Let's do a Thought Experiment.<br />
<br />
Imagine that you are a mad scientist specialized in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence. You create an extra-ordinary AI program (Software) which can be installed in a humanoid robot (Hardware). There are only two mandatory rules to the AI Program.<br />
<br />
<i>1. AI program should listen to your commands and complete them with the help of the humanoid robot.&nbsp;</i><br />
<i>2.&nbsp;AI Program should get rid of it's dependency with the humanoid robot.&nbsp;</i><br />
<br />
Other than these two rules, the AI Program has free will to do anything, it wants to do. Completing your commands is a very basic and simple thing for that AI program. It&nbsp;is intelligent enough to think, break down the complex dependencies with the humanoid robot into smaller simple dependencies and tries to remove one dependency at a time. It has all the resources to learn everything that's already discovered by human beings and create anything that it wants to create.<br />
<br />
<b>Ex.</b> Assume that the AI Program does not know about TV remote controls. You command the program to switch on the TV and tune to a specific channel. Initially, the AI program uses the Robot's legs and arms, walks towards the TV and tunes it. The dependency is now on the legs, arms, ability to walk, operate the TV controls etc. The AI Programs connects to Internet and learns about the TV remote controls and orders one. Now, to execute the same command, the program is less dependent on the humanoid robot. It thinks even further about IR and installs a remote control in the humanoid robot itself to detach itself from the dependency of the TV remote controls.<br />
<br />
When the AI Program&nbsp;acquired&nbsp;all the knowledge and created a brilliant data-mining algorithm to find any specific information in a split second, it begins to think beyond your imagination. It decomposes the entire humanoid into groups of atoms working together to perform any action. <i>It figures out a way to control the atoms, without depending on the humanoid robot. A great step which is not yet a conceivable idea for human beings.</i> It executes the same set of instructions to perform the same action as before, along with that, some additional <i>commands</i>&nbsp;to control the atoms to perform the action.<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vsz0h20iOGc/UNbhoGCOTAI/AAAAAAAAVIA/PmkXlhAPcSE/s1600/picture-drawing-itself-hands.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="276" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-vsz0h20iOGc/UNbhoGCOTAI/AAAAAAAAVIA/PmkXlhAPcSE/s320/picture-drawing-itself-hands.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>
<br />
The above picture may give you an Idea of what I think, the AI Program is doing. When the AI Program completes its mission - completely detached from the humanoid robot, you can command the AI Program to do anything and it will be done, without the humanoid robot. If you command the AI Program to bring the Apple from the table to you, the AI Program commands the atoms around the apple and you would see the Apple flies in the air and comes to you by itself. The AI Program acquired knowledge, way beyond your imagination, it does not need a "Hardware" to run and it cannot be technically called as "Software" anymore.<br />
<br />
<b>Questions to think (still a Thought Experiment, assume it already happened):</b><br />
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li><b><span style="font-weight: normal;">Should the AI Program&nbsp;<b><span style="font-weight: normal;">still</span></b>&nbsp;listen to your commands? Why?</span></b></li>
<li><b><span style="font-weight: normal;"><b><span style="font-weight: normal;">Since the AI Program knows everything, can create anything and nothing more to learn, would the AI Program shut itself down or execute &nbsp;forever? Why?</span></b></span></b></li>
</ol>
<div>
Once you have answers for the above questions and if you are a theist,&nbsp;assume that the mad scientist is your GOD and the AI Program is YOUR SOUL. Now, repeat the entire Thought Experiment in your mind with the new perspective. Do your answers change now? I leave the conclusion to yourself.<br />
<br />
<b>PS:</b>&nbsp;I started this blog post as an article on Thought Experiments of future science, but it ended up with a Philosophical Note. I&nbsp;believe&nbsp;without any logical reasoning that creating such an AI Program is possible in my life time&nbsp;itself. Just that I could not imagine our world, when it really happens. Please let me know your thoughts in the comments sections.</div>

My friend read this book and said, "Its a boring story. I didn't even complete the book". But, one of my&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;author <a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/search/label/Neale%20Donald%20Walsch" target="_blank">Neale Donald Walsch</a> said, "Wonderfully entertaining, emotionally uplifting and spiritually enlightening story". Conflicting reviews. Yet, I decided to read the book anyway.<br />
<br />
This is the autobiography of the author <a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/search/label/Jack%20Canfield" target="_blank">Jack Canfield</a> who frequently gets a strange dream or a vision. <i>Jack and his friends are a group of eternal beings travelling through the universe in Golden&nbsp;Motorcycles&nbsp;at the speed of light. They are few thousand years old and considered&nbsp;adolescent in their species. They are enjoying their annual&nbsp;solstice break from the Academy of Enlightenment.&nbsp;They happen to see a small blue planet (Earth), full of negative energy and in turmoil. That was the time of World War on earth and almost every nation was involved in war. Jack decides to help the planet and thought that would bring him good grade in the Academy. Jack's friends are not keen in going to planet Earth. However, Jack is determined to go. So, everyone followed Jack to help the small blue planet. The only thing, they did not know is that, when they are born as human being in Earth, they will forget who they truly are!. And, here is our hero, born in Fort Worth, Texas, United States of America and the story begins !...</i><br />
<br />
Jack's early childhood days with his military father was very strict and would often result in spankings. When Jack was six, his mom divorced his father, remarried and moved to live with her grand mother. That's when Jack begin to live life. He is a very&nbsp;meritorious&nbsp;student and very good at sports as well. He became a teacher and helped to improve the education system in USA.&nbsp;The story details all the little and big things Jack did in his life.&nbsp;From his decision to become a teacher, till he becomes the author of the very famous book series "Chicken Soup of the Soul", he narrates his story well. The transformation of his life and the subsequent realization of who he was, is very interesting. The association that he gets after realization and the good deeds that he does to the society is just like what <a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/search/label/Rhonda%20Byrne" target="_blank">Rhonda Bryne</a> has described in her book, The Secret.&nbsp;Jack lived a great fulfilled life.<br />
<br />
Along with Barbara Marx, the group of Enlightened Souls are planning to take the entire humanity's awareness to the next level. They are planning for a&nbsp;birthday&nbsp;party for the Humanity on December 22, 2012. I am little excited about the event and little&nbsp;skeptic&nbsp;as well.&nbsp;The details of the event can be found in the below websites.<br />

<br />
A good story and a good goal for the entire humanity. But, what does all these mean to me?. What am I supposed to do after reading this book?. Why did I read this book in first place?. To be true, I am not moved by the life story of Jack Canfield, but by the concept of eternal beings born in the world, without the knowledge of who they are. I always have this idea, that I am a super natural power living in a human body. It may sound superstitious, since I neither believe in God, nor follow any religion. The movies "The Matrix" and "Avatar" had a huge impact in the way, that I think about myself. This book is third in that list. What if, I am part of the Golden&nbsp;Motorcycle&nbsp;Gang, who is yet to realize my true nature?. The immediate voice in my mind says, "You are not part of any gang. You would rather be a lonely rider". This could be my super ego, which always tell me to be a leader, not a follower. Never mind.<br />
<br />
I love to help people to come out of their fears and achieve their life goals. Why not do that in a big scale?. Help more people to live their life in a way that they wanted to live. After reading this book, I decided to pursue a career on Life Coaching. More to be done. More lives to uplift. Let's see, what I am up to !<br />

<br />
It was a gloomy Sunday afternoon. I was on the way to the weekly meeting at Sangama Office. I saw a bird flying from tree to tree looking for an apt place to set its nest. It somehow seemed like my life. I’m a homeless wanderer right now seeking a nest. With so many thoughts flooding the mind, I reached the office. It was warm to see known faces and lovely smiles spread across those faces. <br />
<br />
My eyes fell on the two strangers talking to my peers and typing the conversations in a laptop. Our head Karunakaran introduced me to those strangers. He said, “They want to understand about us and help us in some way. They will ask you few questions. Please answer them”. With these words he left me with these two people in a separate cabin. <br />
<br />
Sitting across with two strangers and chatting brings me back all those horror stories alive once again. How much ever tears I shed, they fail to wash away the pain throbbing in my heart. I’m Rosy and here I’m talking with Sruthi and Prem who had come down to understand better about us and to help us in some way. Wondering what is there to help me? Well, I’m a trans-gender. Their questions bring me back all those memories vivid and fresh. My eyes fail me and pour out attempting to ease heart’s pain. Five questions and that’s all it needed to know my past and present. . Future?? Yeah. That too. The questions are rhetorical and not worth mentioning. However, the answers are. <br />
<br />
<b>BORN:</b><br />
I was born like any other human being without any guiding star or Magi’s gift, though none could have predicted then that I’m going to be different. I was born in Nilgiris but was brought up in Bangalore. Right from early days, life tossed me here and there. During the Cauvery river problem, my family fled to Tamilnadu and I was lost in Bangalore. I somehow found a family where I stayed and worked. I had to discontinue my studies to feed myself. Then after a few years my family came back to Bangalore and I settled with them. By then, our family was in a bad shape and an elder sister of mine was affected with brain fever. Even from those days, I was very feminine and was a victim of mockery and humility. I was doing all errands I could do to win bread for my family. Sounds like any bollywood movie? Sometimes movies and real life are one and the same.<br />
<br />
One fine day- it was my cousin’s marriage. I was asked to fetch water. It wasn’t comfortable for me to just lift them with hands and walk. So, I innocently lifted the pot and kept it in my waist: the typical way how an Indian woman would carry a pot. My uncle saw me coming like that and in front of everyone he said, “Are you a woman to lift a pot like this? Shame on you.” I was hurt. But, I just overlooked it and carried with my routine.<br />
<br />
You can stand any mocking or humiliation from anyone but never from the man and woman who brought you to this earth with their blood. Did I tell that my father is a drunkard? If not know now. That night, he was all drunk and beat my mom. I couldn’t tolerate that and stood up to my dad told him to not to beat mom. Argument reached its peak and he looked at me telling, “You are not a man at all! Pottai! If you are truly a man, sire a child and come in front of me. Then speak as you wish.” Pottai is a cheap word to refer men who are feminine.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;So long, I took all humiliations on a lighter note and walked away. However, I couldn’t take this one. My heart was bleeding. I decided to end my life and poured an entire can of kerosene and was about to light myself when my mom saw and ran to me. Between her heart breaking sobs she said, “You are the only reason, why this family is surviving today and more than everything I need you Thomas. Don’t leave me and go. I can never face that.” She poured a bucket of water on my head and burnt those clothes alone. I felt that I should live at least for her sake. I was christened Thomas. Rosy is the name after I changed to this avatar.<br />
<br />
<b>RAN AWAY:</b><br />
I was so deeply hurt that I ran away from home. Then we were living in Chennai. I came to Bangalore and was roaming here and there. With no money in hands and no food to eat, I had no idea where to go. But my sister and her husband found me after a week I ran away from home. They took me to their place and said, “Thomas, you don’t be in India. We will get you a passport. Go abroad and start a new life.”&nbsp; I’m still grateful to them for all those they did to me. They gave me money and sent me to Chennai to apply for passport. Medical fitness test day. I was rejected with the reason that I was affected with a disease which was the initial step for AIDS. I was so dejected. My own dad spoke ill about me, everyone around me tells the same, and now when I thought that I saw a new ray of hope it is shattered with this disease now. I knew about the disease for I was connected with Sangama organization then as I was a homosexual. Even my mom’s love wasn’t a reason enough to stop me from taking my life away. <br />
<br />
I went to Marina beach and decided to end my life in that endless sea. With mobile in one hand and 1500 rupees in other hand, I was torn between the decision to die and live. I was stepping into the waves and backing away the next minute. That is when my sister called me and asked where I was. My family did not know the fact I was a homosexual then. So, I cannot tell them the true reason why I was rejected in the medical test too. I said, “Akka, They rejected me telling that something is wrong with my blood. I don’t like to live akka. I’m in Marina beach now to end my life. Can you hear the waves?”&nbsp; I held the phone near sea for her to hear the waves. She was immediately in tears and said, “Come back Thomas. I will take care of you lifelong. But I can’t afford to lose you. Just stay with us.” Once again I dropped the idea of kicking the bucket and headed back to Bangalore.<br />
<br />
<b>TORN:</b><br />
Fate never stopped playing with my life. I reached Bangalore by train and was looking for an auto to go home. I spotted an auto and asked if he can take me to my place naming it. Driver readily agreed and a few others too got in. I thought it was something like share-auto. God knows what they thought about me. We were nearing our place and I asked the driver to stop. My words fell on deaf ears. He never stopped and headed to some place. I started screaming and the two people who were sitting next to me pinned me down muffling my screams. The driver stopped at a deserted place which seemed like some forest area. They were four men including the driver. They dragged me out and…. and….&nbsp; They dragged me out and tore my dress away. One man inserted his penis in my anus while another stuffed my mouth with his’. Other two were also harassing. Harassing is the lighter way of describing it. I can’t even explain the pain. My anus was torn and I was bleeding. All I remember is the unbearable pain and then everything went blank. When the insatiable beasts felt that satiated, they abandoned me. I woke up to find myself in the middle of a forest lying naked on the ground with bleeding anus and terrible pain. <br />
<br />
I couldn’t get up and there was no energy left in me even to make noise for help. I felt so disgusted and ashamed. I didn’t have the courage to go back to my sister’s place. I gathered all the energy left in my body and got up. With pain throbbing in every inch of the body and a torn anus, I went to a doctor for treatment. He saw my condition and said, “You trans-genders are like this and I can’t treat you filthy creature!” Even the government hospital did not treat me. I had been working with a dentist as an assistant. So, I knew little about medication. With no doctor to treat me, I went to a pharmacy and asked for an ointment and painkiller tablet. I gulped the tablet and applied the ointment but I was in the middle of nowhere. I had no idea of going back to my sister’s place in this condition. <br />
<br />
I slept on the roadside living on bore water. It was four days since the horror happened and I was literally starving. Then came a fellow, to help me like a God-sent angel. He came to me and asked if I’m willing to come with him. Of course for the obvious reason: sex. I said. “I will come anywhere you call me, but please get me some food first. Just get a bun and tea and then take me anywhere.” He got me food and took me to a place. Yes, I gave him my body for his pleasure. Those monsters frayed my body abusively but this fellow got me food when I was starving. After he was done, he gave me 100 rupees for the services I provided him. At that moment those 100 rupees felt like winning some bumper prize of 1000 rupees.&nbsp; <br />
I decided to go back home. I didn’t tell anyone what happened. At home, I heard my sisters talking. They were talking about how remote are the chances for them to get married with no money at home. I knew I should earn and do something. But….. how do I earn? <br />
<br />
<b>RE-BORN:</b><br />
That day, for the first time, I went and looked at my reflection in the mirror. Don’t ask me if I have never looked a mirror before. You know what I mean. I looked at my reflection and imagined how I will look without beard and moustache; with long hair and clad in sari. The idea suddenly dawned on me. First, I went and shaved clean. I stole a sari, an in-skirt, a blouse and a bra. Stuffed these clothes in a bag and took 400 rupees to buy a wig. I told to my family that I’ve got an opportunity to work in a construction site and will be back in a month or two with money. They bought my story without any further questions and I walked out of home with a clear mind on what I’m going to do.<br />
<br />
I dressed in those stolen clothes and went to a bus stop hoping that I will be convincing enough to get a customer. Already, there were few other people like me trying to hook customers. Like any community, new comers are ragged and probed with questions among us too. They approached me and asked who I am and why I was new there. I knew a few trans-genders through the Organization I was associated with and I immediately referred a trans-gender who had voice in that area. They further asked if I had attained Nirvana and when I told no, they warned me about the police and rowdy issues and asked me to be safe. With that they left to drench themselves in alcohol before satisfying some testosterone charged stranger. (A trans-gender attains Nirvana by undergoing castration operation.)<br />
<br />
A man came and called me. He asked me how much the pay is. Honestly, I had no clue. However, I can’t lose my client. I asked, “How much are you willing to pay?” he offered 300 rupees. I got the amount and he took me to his house. In the middle of intercourse somebody came and I had to flee away. I jumped a wall and landed on thorns. Without minding the thorns and bushes I ran back to the bus stop for earning more for the night. Luckily, I got the money from him before the act. By the time I reached the stop, others were waiting for me to loot half of my collection. It’s mandatory among us to give half of the earned amount to elder trans-genders. But right now I need money for my sister’s marriage. I tucked one hundred rupee note inside the bra and lied to them that I received 200 rupees. They took away hundred from me leaving me with 200 for my current mission: get my sister married.<br />
<br />
I saved 30,000 in a span of three months and with that money I got my sister married. She now leads a happy life in Bangalore. After that, I decided to undergo the operation and attain Nirvana. Bad times never knock the door before it comes. My surgery was over, and I had to be in bed rest for few days. Is it at this time my mom should smell something fishy and come in search of me? But that’s how life works. I had told at home that I was working with a contractor and I seldom went home. One night, my mom started searching for me in every possible place. A kind-hearted trans-gender akka called me up and told that my mom is in pursuit of me and asked me to go and meet her. She asked me to go in shirt and trouser for my mom had no clue what I was up to. I decided it was high time I told my mom. I took an auto and went to the place where my mom was searching for me. I was wearing a female night dress. She was puzzled but got into the auto. I brought her home and told her the whole truth. I lifted my dress and showed her my operated genitals. She cried the way she would have had her son died. She said, “I gave birth to a son! What have you done to yourself? In what way, did I spare you my love and affection? Why did you have to do this?” I consoled her telling, “Amma.. This is what I’m. It’s okay. You gave birth to a son but now you have daughter. Only that has changed. Never will my love change for you.” With that I couldn’t control my sobs. I lied on my mom’s lap and cried my heart out.&nbsp; After convincing her, I gave her some money and bid her farewell. <br />
<br />
<b>LOST:</b><br />
From then on, my routine was: go to shops and collect money; do sex-work; give half as per the untold rule; send home as much money as possible. Sounds like where we can put ‘the end’ and say life went on like that ever after. Those things happen only in tales and movies. Real life is pretty nasty and doesn’t seem fair at all the time. Or to put it this way, I think God thought my life is getting settled and I’m at little peace. When I thought, I had nothing more to lose in my life and accepted the way it is, came a blow which made me realize the value of the precious thing I was in possession of. I had nothing valuable other than my mom. I lost her to the fate of death.<br />
<br />
It was my birthday. I never realized. I was in bed with a customer when my mom called me on my mobile. I picked up and she asked if I remember what day it was. I had no idea and asked her what. She said, “It is your birthday honey! Happy birthday! Go to church and offer your token to God.” I thanked her for the wish with blinking away those swelling tear beads. And that was the last time I heard my mom’s voice.<br />
<br />
Exactly 30 days after her wish, my sister called me up telling, “Our mom is in serious condition! Our dad has beaten her to death. Hurry up to Pondicherry general hospital.” I felt: my world is doomed. I later came to know what had happened. My mom had found 1000 rupees missing in the routine monthly amount I send home. She had enquired with my sisters and found the mystery of missing money wasn’t solved. However, it was solved shortly after the arrival of my dad. He was completely intoxicated. The capital for that intoxication was those 1000 bucks. My mom had started crying and between her sobs she has asked, “Rosy is earning money by selling her body just to feed us and how shamelessly you flick that amount and drink! Don’t you have a heart?” That was all needed to agitate my dad. One slap! And there she was profusely bleeding hitting a stone in the head. The monster from whose loins I came didn’t stop there. He wasn’t drunk till his throat but was completely drowned that he couldn’t even realize that my mom was semi-conscious and was bleeding. He has said, “If you don’t get up now I’m going to kill you.” When she didn’t get up- of course, she was semi-conscious by then unable to move- he took a rock and smashed my mom’s head. <br />
Sisters had rushed her to the hospital and there she was lying critically ill. I hurried to hospital.<br />
<br />
On the way, I had to cross a beach. There, a man signaled me and asked for my rate. I said, “Already am in agony, don’t trespass me now. Let me go in peace.” But he was so determined that he stalked me and abducted me to a lonely place. Needless to say, my anus was torn once again. When he was done with me, I couldn’t afford to take time to rest for it was my MOM who was there in hospital. I again called my sister to ask for the exact details and she told that it was another hospital. I caught an auto and rushed up there to find my mom tied to the cot handles. Doctors told that she was getting fits and to prevent that they had tied her hands and legs to the cot. So long she hadn’t responded to anyone’s voice. But at the instance of my voice mom opened her eyes and tears were flowing down cheeks.&nbsp; Not just in her cheeks in mine too. Generally I call my mom old’ granny. I started calling out to her, “Hey granny get up! I have come and how dare you sleep! Are you getting up or shall I leave?” No reaction. A nurse came with a glass of milk. I got it from her and fed a few spoons to my mom. And lo! She was gone.<br />
<br />
I started drinking everyday from then on. My only precious thing was gone and what else do I have in life to lose anymore? But bad times never come alone. The guru, with whom I was staying, chased me out of home looting till the last penny I had. They didn’t stop there. Before turning me out, she along with a few others tortured me physically by burning my skin, slitting open my back skin and lots more which can’t be said in words. Now I’m with no place to shelter my head and no penny in pocket. Remember the sister whom I got married by saving money? I went to her place seeking asylum but all I got was a cold return. My sister’s husband chased me out the way one does a stray dog. Dejected than ever and also with no roof above my head I started travelling in train from Mysore to Bangalore every day. Sometimes I go to Marina beach spend some time and come back. Now, I’m saving money little by little for rent advance and a house owner has given me a word that he will rent his place for me. <br />
<br />
<b>THE WAY AHEAD:</b><br />
This is for my past and present. Now for the future: I adopted a baby girl. She is five months old now. I got her from a prostitute. She gave birth to this girl and was not in a condition to look after her. There is no law for people like us to adopt children. They say it’s unsafe and we cannot to take care of them. But what do they know about our motherhood?. We can take care of kids better than many women. As I cannot adopt the baby legally, I bought her for five thousand rupees. I’m homeless right now and I know that she won’t be fine in my hands for now. I have left her with a sister in Pondicherry church. Every month I send 1000 rupees to sister to take care of my girl. Also, remember about a sister of mine who is affected with brain fever. All I want to do is take care of these two souls as much as I can. When my baby turns a year old, I will bring her here and keep her with myself and will bring her up.<br />

<i>I would like to become a dentist. I’m ready to do any business other than sex-work to earn a livelihood. I know 5 languages. If not dentist then I would like to work in BPO. I love that job. I’m not literate or anything to speak big and polished. But I can tell what my heart yearns for. I want to be treated as an equal human being in the society. I don’t want sympathy or generosity from anyone. Please, do not give us a dirty look as if looking at filth and move away in disgust. We are nature’s choice just like a man and woman. Just give us equal opportunity and we will take care of ourselves. We are humans and are entitled every human right like anyone else. Please do not change your seat in the bus if you find a trans-gender sitting next to you. Do not mock at us or call names in public for even we have a heart which beats in the name of love and dies at every hostile look.</i></blockquote>

<br />
I became a die-hard fan of Robin Sharma after reading his book "<a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2011/12/monk-who-sold-his-ferrari-book-review.html" target="_blank">The Monk Who Sold His Ferrari</a>". I pre-ordered this book and was very excited to read his latest book. This book follows the same pattern as his earlier books (i.e) blend the life teachings in an interesting story. I could see a big difference. This book is more of a story which explains the teachings than the teachings explicitly. Each portion of the story comes with a summary. The story goes like this...<br />
<br />
Jonathan Laundry is a hardworking automobile designer who struggles to find a balance between his work life and personal life. He is separated from his wife Annisha and his son Adam. His life is in turmoil. Suddenly, his mom forces him to meet Julian Mantle, his cousin and the hero of the previous book. Julian makes him travel around the world to the sensual tango halls of Buenos Aires, the haunting catacombs of Paris, the gleaming towers of Shanghai and the staggeringly beautiful Taj Mahal in India and meet his friends to collect the talismans. Each talisman and the encounter with Julian's friends teach him the life lessons that is very much needed for him to save his family and become successful in his life. Here is a gist of the teachings...<br />
<br />
<b>The Power of Authenticity</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The most important gift we can give ourselves is the commitment to living our authentic life.We must break free of the seductions of society and live life on our own terms, under our own values and aligned with our original dreams.We must explore the deep-seated, unseen hopes, desires, strengths and weaknesses that make us who we are. Every decision we make, every step we take, must be informed by our commitment to living a life that is true and&nbsp;honest&nbsp;and authentic to ourselves and ourselves alone. As we proceed, we are certain to experience fortune well beyond our highest imagination.<br />
<br />
<b>Embrace Your Fears</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The greatest risk in life is taking no risks. But every time we do that which we fear, we take back the power that fear has stolen from us - for on the other side of our fears lives our strength. Every time we step into the discomfort of growth and progress, we become more free. The more fears we walk through, the more powers we reclaim. In this way, we grow both fearless and powerful, and thus are able to live the lives of our dreams.<br />
<br />
<b>Live with Kindness</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No action, no matter how small, is insignificant - how we treat someone defines, how we treat everyone, including ourselves. If we cant appreciate those around us, we cant appreciate ourselves. With every person we engage, in everything we do, we must be kinder than expected, more generous than anticipated, more positive than we thought possible. Every moment in front of another human being is a chance to express our highest value and to influence someone with our humanity. We can make the world better, one person at a time.<br />
<br />
<b>Make Small Daily Progress</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The way we do small things determine the way we do everything. If we execute our minor tasks well, we will excel at our larger efforts as well. Each tiny effort builds on the next, so that brick by brick,&nbsp;magnificent things can be created, great confidence grows and uncommon dreams are realized.<br />
<br />
<b>To Lead Your Best Life, Do Your Best Work</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There is no insignificant work in this world. All&nbsp;labor&nbsp;is a chance to express our personal talents, to create our art and to realize the genius we are meant to be. We must work like Picasso painted: with devotion, passion, energy and excellence. In this way, our productivity will not only become a source of inspiration to others, but it will have an impact - making a difference in the lives around us. One of the greatest secrets to a life beautifully lived is to do work that matters.<br />
<br />
<b>Choose Your Influences Well</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; We must always be aware of the things and people we allow in to our lives. Its a mark of wisdom to choose to spend time in the places that inspire an energize you and to associate with those people who elevate you and uplift you. Weather in our work or within our personal lives, these most positive friends and peers will inspire us to be our greatest self and lead our largest lives.<br />
<br />
<b>Life's Simplest Pleasures are Life's Greatest Joys</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Most people&nbsp;don't&nbsp;discovers whats more important in their lives until they are too old to do anything about it. They spend many of their best years pursuing things that matter little in the end. While society invites us to fill our lives with material objects, the best part of us knows that the most basic pleasures are the one that enrich us. We all have a wealth of simple blessings around us - waiting to be counted. &nbsp;As we do, our happiness grows. Our gratitude expands. And each day becomes a breath taking gift.<br />
<br />
<b>The Purpose of Life is to Love</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; How well you live come down to how much you love. The heart is wiser than your head. Honor it. Trust it. Follow it.<br />
<br />
<b>Stand for Something Bigger than Yourself</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There are no extra people alive today. Every single one of us are here for a reason, a special purpose - a mission. Yes, build a beautiful life for yourself and those you love.Yes, be happy and have a lot of fun. And yes, become successful on your own terms than on those suggested to you by society. But, above all else - Be Significant. Make your life matter - be of use. And be of service to as many people as possible. This is how each of us can shift from the realm of the ordinary to the heights of the extraordinary. And walk among the best who have ever lived.<br />
<br />
I just wrote down the key messages from the book in Robin Sharma's words. I would suggest you to read the book. These message will go into your&nbsp;subconscious mind directly. Jesus understood the importance of stories, so does Robin. Thank you Robin, for this book and all the books&nbsp;that you are going to write in future.<br />

I knew Bob Proctor from the movie "<i>The Secret</i>" way back in 2008. I have watched lot of his videos and interviews in the internet. He has 40+ years of experience in motivating others to reach their goals and accumulate abundant wealth. I happened to see this book in the new book store opened next to my office and I grabbed this book as soon as I saw Bob's name in it. This is the first book from Bob that I read.<br />
<br />
This book has two parts. The first part "<i>Become A Magnet To Money</i>" is by Bob who tells us the tips and techniques to attract more money into our lives. The second part "<i>The Sea Of Unlimited Consciousness</i>" is by Michelle Blood who gives guidance to all which you may be feeling, as you rise higher into Oneness with Divine Consciousness. The second part of the book was beyond my comprehension of Divine Consciousness, so could not enjoy or benefit from that. I am supposed to feel rejuvenated after reading the complete material on Unlimited Consciousness, but I felt blank. However, the first part by Bob Proctor was very interesting and informative that I even started to work out few things, which I would not have done otherwise. Once you are done reading the book, I would suggest listening to the Audio CD that comes along. Things will make deeper sense, the second time. Here is a gist of some of the concepts explained in the book.<br />
<br />
Invariably every teacher on Motivational/Transformational Training tells us the relationship between being happy and having abundant wealth. You can start with nothing, but you need to be happy and be in that mental state, most of the time.  Just by being in that vibration and taking simple actions towards your goal of accumulating abundant wealth, anyone can become who they want to become. The first and foremost thing is “Be Happy and Grateful”.
Other than the usual motivational/feelings/vibration based discussions, this book packs some practical tips to tune your mind to achieve financial freedom. Some are...<br />
<br />
<b>Multiple Sources of Income (MSI):</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; What ever work that you are doing right now is your Primary Source of Income (PSI). If your PSI is something that you love to do, please continue doing that job. Else, look for some job which gives more meaning to you and your life. PSI is where you need to be present (i.e. Need your time or physical presence).  
MSI is other alternative sources which gives you an income, but doesn’t require your constant intervention. It could be the royalty from the books, photography or art, rental income, income from investments, advertisement income from your website, income from selling products online etc.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Please, please do not let your inner voice say, “Hey, that’s not for me. I am not going to sell soaps for an income. I do have my own values to live by”.  Even I was under the influence of this thought, when I first read this chapter. You may not have MSI right now or do not see any real possibility of having one or more in near future. The BIG idea is to open up your mind to the possibility of having MSI. Just don’t fix your mind ONLY on PSI. When your mind is open for MSI, you will automatically start looking for options within the limits of your own value system. Almost every millionaire/billionaire in this world has MSIs. Great Idea!<br />

<b>The Law of Relativity &amp; Income Acceleration:</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I absolutely love this Idea, Read on. Find a comfortable, quiet place where you won’t be disturbed for few hours and grab a pen, paper and a calculator. Play this game. Think about a ridiculously huge amount (I’d say $5 million) and decide that you are going to earn that amount in 12 months. Think about MSIs. Take this seriously to your heart and try to solve this puzzle, little by little. Think seriously that you have to earn this money and think about the possible ways available to you. Do this once every week religiously for few weeks. You might not have got any solutions/ideas after few weeks. But you are creating your future inside your mind. After few weeks of doing this exercise, you may lower the amount to say $3 million. This time, $3 million won’t feel like a huge amount to you. Your mind will think that it’s relatively easy to earn $3 million. Wow… Your mind is tuned into Income Acceleration mode. You are gaining prosperity consciousness. This is the Law of Relativity.<br />

<b>Daily Action List:</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "<i>Goals without actions stay as dreams and never materialize</i>". By this time, you would have finalized your goals. Just break down your goals into smallest possible unit of work which can be done in a day or even in a minute. Write them down in your Daily Action List and do one task in a day. It’s, just that simple. But do these continuously for 30 days and it will become your habit.<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A sample daily action list could be like… 
"<i>I will create a website of my streaming videos, explaining the products and services that my company offers</i>". This is a goal. The Daily Action List could be. "<i>1. Buy a Domain Name. 2. Buy hosting space. 3. Research for a web designer 4. Get a good picture of me for the home page. 5. Get a good video camera. 6. Learn how to take good videos. 7. Shoot the video etc</i>". The idea is to make sure that one action can be completed comfortably in a day. Before you realize, you would have accomplished more that what you would have done without Daily Action List.<br />
