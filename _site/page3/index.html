<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<b>Common Myth:</b> Raw food eaters are skinny and it's impossible for them to pack on muscles.</blockquote>
<br />
I believed in this myth for a very long time.&nbsp;Who wants to be skinny and vulnerable?. Not me. Just like any other man, I always wanted to be big and strong. If I get options to either live for 30 years, big and strong or live for 100 years skinny but very healthy, I will always choose the first option. But, if I can be big, strong, healthy and can live for 100 years, why would not I say YES?. The next question is how?. The above video explains it all. All claims in this video are true?. I do not know at this point. But there are strong supporting evidences.<br />
<br />
Let's analyze from evolution point of view.<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2IfFbF9-V2w/UPPjh0CUvAI/AAAAAAAAVJ8/3kfSsrAb7sY/s1600/evolution-human-brain.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-2IfFbF9-V2w/UPPjh0CUvAI/AAAAAAAAVJ8/3kfSsrAb7sY/s320/evolution-human-brain.jpg" width="260" /></a></div>
Many scientists believe that the cooked food in human diet is responsible for the evolution of a bigger brain. Human brain consumes roughly 20% of the calories that goes into the body. Cooked foods are packed with more calories, easy to chew, tastes better and could sustain few more days, which gave our ancestor the advantage of having more time to socialize and less time in searching for food. Since human brain is nourished with more food and given more time to think, it is increased in size.<br />
<br />
A sensible and logical conclusion from fossil evidences. Somehow, I could not agree with this. If you compare the brain size of the apes between 3.5 million years and 1.8 million years (roughy when Homo erectus started cooking), you can see the increase in brain size. (i.e) evolution is already started.<br />
<br />
What is mysterious is, the accelerated rate at which the brain size increased from 1.8 millions years onwards. Since, Action A (Cooking) and Action B (Brain Size Increasing) happened around the same time, concluding that action B is due to action A - does not make sense to me.<br />
<br />
Let's come to the present. We all eat cooked food and know the long list of diseases/disorders that will be caused by those foods. Most probably, it is not the cooked food that causes the diseases, but the preparation of the foods and amount of food we eat,&nbsp;causes&nbsp;the diseases/disorders. Properly cooked healthy food in proper proportion, with proper exercise helps us maintain good health. However, raw foodists claim better health, vitality, creative thinking, anti-aging and being energetic with raw food. Too good to be true. Is n't it?. Let's see what is termed as raw food.<br />
<br />
<b>Cooked Food:</b> Any processing/preparation of food that&nbsp;involves application of heat higher than 118° F. I seriously do not know, who came up with this number.<br />
<br />
<b>Raw Vegan Food:</b> All the food items that falls into the below categories. Only plant based food. No animal and dairy products.<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Heating food less than 118° F</li>
<li>Pureeing</li>
<li>Blending</li>
<li>Marinating</li>
<li>Fermenting</li>
<li>Dehydrating</li>
<li>Sprouting</li>
<li>Eating as it is</li>
</ul>
Here are some of the key points discussed in all the debates "Cooked Vs Raw"<br />
<br />
<b>Digestive Enzymes are destroyed in Cooking:</b> This is the most discussed topic. Our scientists so far, claimed that all enzymes from the plant foods are&nbsp;destroyed&nbsp;in Hydrochloric acid (HCl) secreted in our stomach, with exceptions to digestive enzymes from&nbsp;<span style="color: blue;"><b><i>Papaya, Pineapple and Kiwi fruit. </i></b></span>So, eating these three fruits after a heavy meat based diet is good for digestion. However, recent unconfirmed study says that, the food stays in the body for roughly 45 minutes, before being subjected to HCl treatment. So, the digestive enzymes are being absorbed and used by our body. More research is needed.<br />
<b><br /></b>
<b>Vitamin B12 deficiency in Raw Vegan Foods: </b>This special vitamin is needed for normal functioning of brain, nervous system and formation of blood. Daily requirement is roughly 2.5 micrograms. This vitamin is produced by bacteria and it's not available in most of the plant sources. True. However, recent research claims that&nbsp;<b><i><span style="color: blue;">Chlorella, Miso and &nbsp;Nutritional yeast</span></i></b> do have vitamin B12. These are regional foods and are not available throughout the world. So, many raw foodist adjust this deficiency with vitamin supplements (either daily or weekly). However, we could get this vitamin from <b><i><span style="color: blue;">a cup of milk/curd/yogurt. </span></i></b>This would be the simplest way. Even, if you switch to raw food and do not consume vitamin B12, it may take upto three years for your body to show the symptoms of this deficiency.<br />
<b><br /></b>
<b>You need to eat more with Raw Vegan Foods: </b>That is 100% true. Due to the low calorific value of raw foods, we need to eat more and more often. It was tough millions of years ago. With the abundance of food sources available right next to our door, this should not be a problem. Even with cooked food, the experts suggests us to eat six small meals rather than 3 large meals. With Raw Vegan foods, we will be forced to follow that pattern, which is good for us. Isn't it?<br />
<b><br /></b>
<b>Reversal of chronic diseases with Raw Vegan Food: </b>Many people claim to have reversed the chronic diseases like diabetes, heart diseases,&nbsp;arthritis&nbsp;and even some types of cancer in few weeks to few months of eating raw vegan food. Scientific human trials are needed to confirm these claims.<br />
<b><br /></b>
<b>Extreme Endurance with Raw Vegan Foods: </b>Once I saw the above video and inspired to know more about raw foods, I stumbled upon <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brendan_Brazier" target="_blank">Brendan Brazier</a>, who is the author of "The Thrive Diet" and a professional Ironman Triathlon athlete. (It's a triathlon race consisting of a 3.86 km swim, a 180.25 km bicycle ride and a marathon 42.2 km run, raced in that order and without a break. He could complete this race within 9 hours. I never knew such things are possible with Vegan foods.<br />
<b><br /></b>
<b>Anti-Aging with Raw Foods: </b>Hundreds of living evidences are available through out the world in many countries. Below is one such example.<br />
<br />

<b><br /></b>How sure I am about her age being 71?. 0%. Yes. This is just a video uploaded in youtube by someone who loves raw food. There is no reliable way to verify it. However, my instinct says that this could be possible. Around 15 years back, &nbsp;when I was a kid, I read a very old book in Tamil, (இயற்கை உணவுகள் - I think. Can't remember the title exactly) about raw foods which detailed the health benefits and extreme endurance possible with raw foods. When combined with the proper exercise, I believe this could be the right way of life for me.&nbsp;Only way to know is to experiment it.<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq" style="text-align: center;">
<b><span style="color: blue;">I am going to try Raw Vegan Foods for 3 months. If it brings the benefits that it claims, I will continue. Else, I will return back to the cooked foods.</span></b></blockquote>

We all know what "Science" is. But, what does it mean to say that something is "scientific"?. Astronomy is science. What about Astrology?. Main stream medicine is science. What about faith healing? Or energy meridian tapping?. What does the label "scientifically proven" mean to us?. How do we verify the claims of science and the theories proposed by scientists?. If these questions pops up in your mind when you look at the title, then you must read this book.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, Philosophy is all about asking questions, examining arguments and getting clear with the reality. Do you know that Science emerged from Philosophy?. In one way, I could say that Science is a&nbsp;specialized&nbsp;branch of philosophy. Yes. Science was initially called as "Natural Philosophy" until eighteenth century. I did not know that. I love science, read about all possible latest inventions in science. But, never traced the origin of Science. I am so happy to have read this book. Otherwise, my knowledge about understanding of science would never be complete.<br />
<br />
This book examines the methods and arguments used in science to validate the scientific claims. It will help us to clarify or simplify the language used by science. It examines the logic by which theories are developed in Science. After reading this book, if someone tells you a new scientific logic or proposal, you can validate the idea by your self with various methods. How awesome is that?<br />
<br />
The chapter <b>The history of science</b>, gives us the brief overview of science from medieval age till today's digital world. It's very interesting to see gradual progress science has made over the years and their contributors.<br />
<br />
Some of the key discussions in this book are ...<br />
<br />
<b>Scientism</b> is the view that science is the only source of factual knowledge.<br />
<br />
<b>Deductive argument&nbsp;</b>starts with a general principal and deduces other things from it. Ex., if we assume that all heavenly bodies must be perfect spheres, then a logical deduction is that there cannot be any mountains on the moon.<br />
<br />
<b>Inductive argument&nbsp;</b>starts with observations or experimental results and sets the general principles taking them in to account. Ex., if we see mountains on the moon, then you can conclude inductively that not all heavenly bodies are perfect spheres.<br />
<br />
<b>Abductive argument</b> just tries to infer a reason for a present phenomenon. You don't frame any theory, just try to explain the situation. Ex., if you see an unopened letter on the pavement, you may conclude that the postman must have dropped it (out of million other possibilities).<br />
<br />
<b>Logical Positivists</b> position was that the only valid statements by Science were those confirmed by experimental or observational evidence. Ex., If I say that there is a dog in the room, I actually mean that, if you go into that room, you will see a dog. Simple. It rejects everything else. This concept helped boost the progress of Science in early days. However, the latest relativity theory and quantum physics does not fit into this narrow schema.<br />
<br />
<b>The theory of falsification</b> says that, a scientific theory cannot be proved to be true by simply adding new conforming evidences. If some piece of sound evidence goes against your theory, it may be enough to show that the theory is false. The theory is not discarded immediately. It just means that there is something out there, which the theory cannot account for. So, in theory, if any theory is claimed to be scientific, then it may be possible for it to be falsified.<br />
<br />
These are just few of the concepts discussed in the book in early chapters. This book discusses a whole range of scientific questions like "Do we know things, or only our experience of them?", major scientific discoveries throughout the history, how the new theories challenged and replaced the old theories, the observations of those scientists which made them create the theories, the methodology used by them to conclude a theory, recent economic influences on scientific discoveries etc.<br />
<br />
This book is a feast of information for those who wish to understand Science in totality. For casual readers, the first chapter <b>The history of Science</b> is good enough to get a grip of Science. I recommend this book for everyone.<br />

Thermal Diet?. Yeah. It's from the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030746363X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=030746363X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=booiverea-20" target="_blank">The 4-Hour Body</a> by my favorite author Timothy Ferriss.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
Everyone knows the basic fact that our body temperature is maintained at 98.6 °F. When the outside temperature falls below that, our body does quite a few things like goosebumps, shivering, burning more calories to produce the additional heat to bring the core temperature back to normal. The hypothalamus in the brain controls the body temperature with the help of the temperature receptors in the skin. We are interested in leveraging the option of "burning more calories for heat" to our weight loss program.</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
There are two types of fat tissues found in mammals.</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<b>White Adipose Tissue (WAT)</b> - which stores fat, also called as white fat. The excess calories that we consume are converted into energy reserves as white fat around our waist and thighs.</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<b>Brown Adipose Tissue (BAT)</b> - which burns fat to produce heat (also called as brown fat). This is present around the&nbsp;lower neck and supraclavicular regions.</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
When our body is exposed to cold, the brown fat is activated to burn more calories (mostly from white fat) to produce heat&nbsp;until we reach the point of shivering, which takes over to produce more heat.&nbsp;Studies shows that our body burns 50% more calories when exposed to cold conditions.&nbsp;Babies don't shiver because they have&nbsp;approx. 5% of their body weight composed of brown fat. We&nbsp;lose most of it as we grow. The&nbsp;high amount of brown fat replaces the need to shiver. Contrary to the popular belief, thinner people has more brown fat !.</div>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
<b>Thermal Diet</b> &nbsp;- is the concept of leveraging our body's natural ability to burn fat to effective weight loss. Please remember, brown fat works best at the threshold of shivering. If you find yourself shivering, it may be too cold for you and it is possible to slip into the state of hypothermia, if you are not careful. So, always have an option of getting to a warmer condition, if required.</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
<span style="color: red;"><b>Extreme cold could cause complications for people with cardiovascular problems. So,&nbsp;Please consult with your physician before attempting any of the suggestions below. Please consult even if you don't have any health problems.</b></span></div>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
</div>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><b>Drink Cold Water:</b> Drink a glass of ice cold water as soon as you wake up followed by a breakfast in next 30 mins (refer <a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/08/building-perfect-physique-tip-1-eat.html">Tip 1</a>). Through out the day, drink a lot of ice cold water.</li>
<li><b>Use Ice Packs:</b> Place and Ice Pack on the back of your neck and top of your chest for 30 minutes, while reading or watching TV. Use the idle time to lose weight !</li>
<li><b>Go for "Chill" walks:</b> In cold climate, walk in the streets with normal dress (may be summer dress) for 10 - 15 mins. Be sure to cover your head, neck, hands and feet as they become numb, in extreme cold. I suggest to carry your jacket or coat with you, should you get yourself warmed immediately.</li>
<li><b>Take Cold Showers:</b> Tim Ferriss suggests a 30 mins of cold shower for maximum benefit, but shorter showers also help.&nbsp;Gradually&nbsp;reduce the temperature in the shower and stand in the cold water for 3 - 5 minutes, before getting out. People living in warmer countries or do not have the access to temperature controlled showers, can try to shower in normal / cold water (without heating).</li>
<li><b>Take Ice Baths:</b> Fill your bath tub with cold water and put as much ice cubes as you can. Immerse yourself into the water upto your waist for 10 minutes, then up to your neck with your hands out for next 10 minutes. You can change the time &amp; temperature as it works for you. Tim Ferris takes three ice baths per week.</li>
<li><b>Go Outdoors for Exercise:</b> If you live in cold climate, try to exercise outdoors where you can burn more calories. Go for running, jogging or biking etc.</li>
<li><b>Water Exercise or Sports:</b> If you can, involve in any sport or exercise that is done in water.</li>
</ul>

Seriously, its been hell of a three months. I was religiously following all the tips on every single day. I lost three kilograms of weight in the first month and slowly gained it back at the end of three months. Now, I am exactly at the same point where I started. This is not what you expect from me. Isn't it?. But, this is the truth. When I told this to my friends, everyone has their version of the same story. Hmm... Looks like a universal problem !<br />
<br />
When I started this programme to lose weight, I was supercharged initially and unconsciously I reduced the amount of food that I eat. My wife use to complain everyday. Gradually, my wife's complaints stopped. You guessed it right. I am back to square one. Does this mean that all these tips wont work?. A hell NO. May be, I am missing a key ingredient. May be, these tips are supposed to work together, complement each other to be effective.<br />
<br />
So, I am gonna add one more ingredient&nbsp;to my plan. Physical Exercises.&nbsp;Wait.. wait.. I am not going to join the gym today.. OK. I am gonna start is slow and steady. Take small baby steps to my dream of having a six pack beach body. I should choose an exercise, which must be simple to start, but very effective. So, I &nbsp;chose one of my&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;exercises ever - Burpee !<br />
<br />
Here is one video, which explains Burpee for the beginners. He broke down the exercise to 5 simple levels, to make it easy for the beginners. If you are new to workouts, please try to be comfortable with each level, before proceeding to the next. I suggest, three minutes of simple warm up and three sets of 10&nbsp;repetitions for each level. Take a minute or two rest, between sets. Once you are comfortable with one level, you can move to the next level.<br />

If you already has the experience of working out in the gym, you may start the explosive Burpees, right away. She&nbsp;inspired&nbsp;me very much today. Lets Go !!!<br />

<br />
There is a very old saying/proverb in Tamil "இளைத்தவனுக்கு எள்ளு, கொழுத்தவனுக்கு கொள்ளு" which means "Feed <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sesame_seed" target="_blank">Sesame seed</a> to a skinny person,&nbsp;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_gram" target="_blank">Horse gram</a> to an obese person".<br />
<br />
Horse gram is called Kollu (கொள்ளு) in Tamil. This use to be one of the regular ingredients in South Indian food for so many centuries; fading away slowly for pizzas and burgers. This is mainly fed as fodder to horses for it's nutritional values. Horses and us eat the same food?. I don't mind. Since, most men secretly desire to have few "features" of horses. he he he :) Jokes apart, I am surprised at the medicinal aspects of Horse gram and regretted that I never ate Kollu in my life. I wish I had. Here are they;<br />
<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Excellent Natural Fat Burner</li>
<li>Lowering&nbsp;Cholesterol&nbsp;levels</li>
<li>Regulates blood pressure and blood glucose levels</li>
<li>Horse gram powder mixed water helps in controlling boils and skin rashes</li>
<li>The water that was used in boiling horse gram helps in regulating fever</li>
<li>Helps to dissolve kidney stones and expel them through the urethra</li>
<li>Helps to cure Rheumatism</li>
<li>Regulating and purifying&nbsp;Mensuration</li>
<li>Controlling post-delivery bleeding (Pregnant&nbsp;Women must avoid this)</li>
<li>Reduces pain in dry piles</li>
<li>Reduces flatulence</li>
<li>... the list goes on...</li>
</ul>
<br />
Horse gram can be used in variety of South&nbsp;Indian&nbsp;dishes as a regular dhal or mixed with regular dhals. I included the&nbsp;recipes&nbsp;in this blog to help you prepare them. Alternatively, you can use them as sprouts or as powder.<br />
<br />
I am going to drink a glass of water mixed with two teaspoons of horse gram powder in empty stomach every morning.&nbsp;As usual, I will post an update to the effects of eating Kollu (Horse gram) in my next post.<br />
<br />
<b>Warning:</b> Excessive consumption may increase the body heat. If you are planning to start this diet,&nbsp;Please consult with your physician for your medical condition before&nbsp;starting&nbsp;this diet.&nbsp;I would suggest two times a week. You can increase gradually as you get yourself comfortable with this diet.<br />

<b>Update from previous tips:</b><br />
<br />
So far, we were trying to make simple lifestyle changes to maintain the ideal weight for as long as we live. I don't prefer to lose the weight quick and gain it back. With the previous tips, I was able to lose 1.5 kg in the beginning and I hit a plateau. My weight fluctuates on a daily basis, but I average around the same weight range. The weight does not seem to shed off automatically.&nbsp;So, I am going to change my diet a little bit with this. Let's see what happens.<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<br /></div>
An interesting observation from the chart is that I gain weight the second day after I had party/ate too much food. Very little data to establish this as a pattern, but interesting.&nbsp;If you are new to this blog, you may want to read the other tips ...<br />

<br />
<b>What is a Mind Movie?</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before I answer that question, I suggest you read this blog completely, so that you know by yourself. I don't want anyone to blindly follow me. OK?<br />
<br />
You might be reading this blog in your home or office or at internet cafe or even in your mobile. Just pause for a while. Look around you.&nbsp;Consciously look at each and every object around you. Notice even the smallest things that are made by man. I am sitting in my living room and I could see hundreds of things. My laptop, the table, the cup with water, a notebook, a pen, sofas behind me, TV, Phone&nbsp;etc.<br />
<br />
How many of these objects were there 100 years ago?. May be a 10%?. How about 10,000 years ago?. May be nothing. Where did all these objects come from?. Definitely not from Heaven or from God. We made this. All these things were once, just a thought or an idea in someone's mind.&nbsp;How did a thought become a thing?. We all know that not every thought materializes. Just a thought or idea is not enough. We need an inspired thought or idea - Yes. That's all it takes. You need to be inspired by an idea to manifest them in reality.<br />
<br />
<b>What difference an inspiration brings?</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Our brain gets around two million bits of information per second and our subconscious mind can process about only 40,000 bits per second. So, the incoming data must be differentiated to important and not-so-important categories and the important ones must be processed. This is&nbsp;achieved&nbsp;by Reticular Activating System (RAS) which is present in our brain stem.<br />
<br />
The highest priority filter in RAS is survival instinct. Next comes our belief system about our identity, values, experiences,&nbsp;repetitive thoughts etc. If you are inspired to do something, you keep thinking about that all day and RAS begins to look out for information related to your goal. Suddenly you will begin to see excellent&nbsp;opportunities around you to&nbsp;achieve&nbsp;your goal. How is RAS related to inspiration?. When you are inspired with an idea, you put that idea in your RAS which in turn registers that idea in your subconscious mind.<br />
<br />
The difference between having an idea in your conscious mind and subconscious mind is that, your subconscious mind does not know the reality. (i.e. no negative thoughts) If you believe that you can fly, you will fly (thanks to Wright brothers). If you just think about an idea in your conscious mind, but do not believe that it is possible, you conscious mind will interfere and present you a lot of facts that is not possible. Eventually you may end up not doing it. I am not saying that conscious mind is bad. It is required to keep you in the safe zone (survival instinct). But, it does not have to apply for all actions.<br />
<br />
<b>How to get your goals in to your RAS?&nbsp;</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Only one possible answer is "Repetition". There is no other proven shortcuts. Few ways that I know are: (google to find more)<br />
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li>Affirmations</li>
<li>Visualization</li>
<li>Meditation</li>
<li>Vision Boards</li>
<li>Mind Movies
</li>
<li>Positive Thinking (Replace the -ve one with +ve one)</li>
<li>Emotional Freedom Technique</li>
<li>Subliminal Messages (Audio + Video)</li>
<li>Paraliminal Messages</li>
<li>Gratitude</li>
</ol>
<b>What is a Mind Movie?</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Of all the methods available, the one that is very easy to implement and very good at results is Mind Movies. It's just the advanced version of Vision Boards which&nbsp;project your goals as a movie, engages your visual, hearing and emotional senses. Many people have difficulties to imagine themselves in the perfect life. When you ask them to imagine, they may see a blank screen. Mind Movies are&nbsp;effective because it presents what you want to imagine in the screen before you. You don't have to force yourself to imagination.&nbsp;All you have to do is, to imagine yourself in that movie. Its your movie anyway.<br />
<br />
Remember "Repetition" is the key !... So, try to watch your mind movie as much as you can in a day. I suggest to watch it thrice a day at least. Once you wake up, once during the day and once before going to bed. If you have a smartphone please download the video into it and watch it as and when you can. The more your watch, the faster you will move towards achieving the perfect body.<br />
<br />
You may not be able to relate yourself to the movie in the initial days. Because, you conscious mind will tell you that it is not you, shut that down and go back to what you were doing. Just hang on. Trust me. Sooner than you think, you will believe that it is possible to get the perfect physique. How soon?. It depends on the individuals belief system that was developed from their child hood.&nbsp;By&nbsp;repeatedly&nbsp;watching the movie, you tell your RAS that this stuff is important and do not filter out any information related to&nbsp;achieving&nbsp;the perfect body.<br />
<br />
When the message gets to your subconscious mind, you will be automatically inspired to do few things. May be, you will get attracted to the proper diet or you may want to exercise a little bit. Look for those little impulses and act on. When you act, it will feel effortless and easy, because you are inspired. The movie just opens up the possibilities to you. It's you that have to the lifting. But, never ever force yourself to do the things mentioned in the Mind Movies. That won't sustain.<br />
<br />
<b>A gift for you</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; I spent couple of weeks to create two mind movies (for men and women) to help&nbsp;achieve&nbsp;the perfect health. I did not concentrate too much on the weight loss, but on the perfect health (staying positive). There are costly&nbsp;software&nbsp;available from the creator Ryan on his <a href="http://www.mindmovies.com/" target="_blank">official website</a>. However, I used <a href="http://picasa.google.com/" target="_blank">Picasa 3.0</a>&nbsp;to create these movies for free. I can tell you how to do it yourself in the next blog probably. If you have good internet connection, you can watch these movies either on my blog or on youtube. If you dont, I suggest you to download the movie to your computer (google to figure out how)<br />

This was the typical reaction when I first read about the claim. I did research further and found that this tip works for many people. It may work for me. The best part is, this personal&nbsp;experiment&nbsp;was conducted by <a href="http://evernote.com/corp/team.php" target="_blank">Phil Libin</a>, the CEO of <a href="http://www.evernote.com/" target="_blank">EverNote</a>,&nbsp;one of the fastest growing company in Silicon Valley and this tip is published in Timothy Ferris's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030746363X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=030746363X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=booiverea-20" target="_blank">The 4 Hour Body</a>" as well.<br />
<br />
<b>Weight Awareness Experiment:</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In 2008, Phil Libin weighing 258 pounds, decided to lose weight by doing NOTHING. Yes!!!. He wanted to find the effect of precisely aware of his weight would have on his weight. He actually made a&nbsp;conscious effort to continue to eat whatever he wanted and got absolutely no exercise during this experiment.<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LGlQaTzqZj8/UEsWLvAqgBI/AAAAAAAAVB0/VMmtbGLQS1g/s1600/weighing-scale.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-LGlQaTzqZj8/UEsWLvAqgBI/AAAAAAAAVB0/VMmtbGLQS1g/s320/weighing-scale.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>
<br />
<b>Experiment </b>- He weighed himself (naked) everyday around the same time, before breakfast. So, he knows where he is on a daily basis. He decided his ideal weight would be 230 pounds (when he weighed 280 pounds) and plotted the details in an excel sheet with his actual weight, ideal weight, maximum weight, and minimum weight. He lost <b>28 pounds in six months</b> without making the slightest effort to change his&nbsp;behavior. Unbelievable. Is n't it?<br />
<br />
Just the awareness of how much you weigh on a daily basis, affects thousands of minute decisions that you make over the period of time, even though you would not realize that. How powerful !<br />
<br />
You wanna try this experiment?. I strongly suggest that you do.<br />
<br />
<b>The Excel Sheet</b> - Phil drew three different downward lines in an excel sheet. One for his actual weight, one for the maximum weight he can go up and one for the minimum weight he can go down. The downward slope for max and min weight, follows the pattern - today's weight should be less than (0.1%) of the previous weight. Pretty easy?. The downward slope for his actual weight is his actual weight.&nbsp;He plotted his weight against the excel sheet everyday.&nbsp;It was not always down. Sometimes, it goes up. But the weight reduction is very gradual over the period of two years.<br />
&nbsp; <br />
Looking at the results, I decided to try this. I created my own excel sheet based on Phil's experiment. I am going to try this for 90 days. I will post my graph after 3 months. I am going to measure my weight in kilograms (not in pounds). This is my initial graph with just only day weight plotted.<br />

<!--        <br/><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
Its been more than a week, following the <a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2012/08/building-perfect-physique-tip-1-eat.html" target="_blank">first tip</a>. I already feel slimmer (just feel. OK) and my appetite is reduced. (Its true. Trust me). I eat a lot lesser and feel full. I used to eat muffins daily, right after coming from office. I replaced muffins with bananas. I don't have a&nbsp;weighing&nbsp;scale at home right now and planning to get one today. As and when I post the next tip, I will publish my progress also. Within one week, I don't see any visible&nbsp;reduction&nbsp;in weight, but feeling good that I am doing something to build the perfect physique.<br />
<br />
Today's tip may look&nbsp;weird. If you google, you could find that 50% claims that it works and others claim that it doesn't. I am going to try this tip and will blog about it further, if it works.<br />
<br />
<b><span style="color: blue;">Blue Color -&nbsp;unappetizing color:</span></b><br />
<br />
If you look at our nature/environment, you would not find many natural plants/foods in blue color (except for blueberries). Thousands of years of evolution with nature, <b><span style="color: blue;">our brain does not recognize blue colored food as something safe to eat</span></b>. This evolutionary instinct is to protect the people from eating dangerous or poisonous food. Even today, this&nbsp;instinct is alive at some level in everyone. This instinct may spread over the environment in which we eat food as well.<br />
<br />
If your instinct is strong, you may feel reduction in appetite when you eat food surrounded with blue color. If your instinct is weak, it will not make a difference. Nevertheless, its good to try and check it out by yourself. Since this does not require to make conscious effort, I am going to try it.<br />
<br />

Funny things apart, there are few simple things that we can do. This requires just the initial set-up and let the blue color work for you. You are free to choose the shade of blue you like. Don't make the dining room, a dull place.&nbsp;Be as creative as you can and make it interesting.<br />
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li>Cover your dining table with blue color</li>
<li>Use blue colored plates for eating</li>
<li>Paint your dining area in blue color. (if possible)</li>
<li>Wear blue shaded sunglasses (WTF?)</li>
</ol>

&nbsp; &nbsp; It may sound strange, but people do wear blue color shaded sunglasses to avoid themselves from overeating. They claim that it works and started selling weight-loss-sunglasses. As with any advancement in technology, it started in Japan. Check out the advertisement by clicking the image.&nbsp;</div>

Why am I interested in this thing, with the claims of a bunch of unknown people, and unknown doctors and no proved evidence in science?. Just because, Johnny Depp tried this to reduce weight for one of his movies (he he he he... the blue color could be a co-incidence also). I am not mad enough to wear a blue color sunglasses all day, but I would try other options in the dining area.</div>

We know the color that reduces&nbsp;appetite&nbsp;and&nbsp;obviously&nbsp;we would like to know the opposite. right?. I will leave that to you to google and find out. But looking at the logos of the big fast food chains may give you a clue !</div>

<br />
Our first tip is from Timothy Ferris's "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/030746363X/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=030746363X&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=booiverea-20" target="_blank">The 4-Hour Body</a>". This is quite a simple tip and would not be very tough to follow. Just eat your breakfast as soon as you wake up, preferably within 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
I have the habit of drinking 500 ml of water every morning as soon as I wake up which helps to&nbsp;cleanse&nbsp;my body and have a clean bowel movement. I believe many of you have this habit as well. What to do now?. Eat breakfast first or drink water first?.<br />
<br />
<b>My Schedule for an early breakfast:</b><br />
<br />
This is what I did yesterday ...<br />
<br />
1. Wake up by 6.30 AM<br />
2. Brush my teeth - 5 mins<br />
3. Drink a big glass of water (that has the same effect of drinking a&nbsp;liter&nbsp;of water - from my experience)<br />
4. Prepare the cereals and wait for 15 mins<br />
5. Start eating breakfast. (Within 30 minutes)<br />
<br />
I eat a big bowl of cereals/muesli&nbsp;with cold milk every day. &nbsp;I like the taste and the less time it takes to prepare. I have been eating the same breakfast for over 5 years now and I never got bored with this food. However, not many of you are like me. Many of you prefer a variety of breakfast. In that case, it would not be possible to prepare the breakfast within 30 minutes. At least try to eat your breakfast within an hour.&nbsp;If you are married or having someone to prepare your breakfast, you are lucky. All others, plan for a week ahead for your breakfast and stick to it.<br />
<br />
Many of us wake up an hour or so before the work time and hurry up the morning routine. Eating breakfast is generally the last thing that people do and are very susceptible to skip it. If that is the case with you, please try to wake up a little bit earlier (how little is up to you) and eat breakfast as the first thing in the morning.<br />
<br />
<i>Never ever skip the breakfast.</i><br />
<br />
That's one of the surest way to gain weight. Eating breakfast early resets the metabolism. Think this, you have been fasting for 8+ hour and you must break it. Isn't it?<br />
<br />
<b>Protein Rich breakfast:</b><br />
<br />
Generally I tend to eat simple breakfast with lot of carbohydrates (to give us energy throughout the day). I do that till today. I would say, I was ignorant of the importance of protein in the breakfast. I would stack up protein in the lunch and the dinner, but not in the breakfast. Tim suggests us otherwise.<br />
<br />
<i>The more protein you eat in breakfast, the more fat you will lose.&nbsp;</i><br />
<br />
That's amazing. Isn't it?. Eat early breakfast with at least 40% of protein. The simplest way to reduce weight. One important thing is that you must never be hungry. Eat till you are full. I am planning to add 4 hard boiled eggs to my breakfast. (A bowl of Muesli + Cold Milk + 4 Hard Boiled Eggs). I will post an update as soon as I have some noticeable effect of this simple tip.<br />
<br />
<b>Drink more water and more often:</b><br />
<br />
<i>The protein rich meal is not good for the kidneys</i> - Heard of this statement?. Don't let this stop you. There is no evidence to prove this statement, and yet the myth lives. But, if you have a serious medical condition, please consult with your doctor. To ensure optimal liver function for fat loss, increased hydration is a must. Make special efforts to drink more water everyday.<br />
<br />
I take one liter bottle to Office everyday and complete the bottle twice (1 - morning till afternoon, 2 - afternoon till evening). I feel the need to urinate often, when I do this, which is actually good for my body. This gives me break from the glazing at the monitor&nbsp;continuously, which is a good thing.<br />
<br />
So, today's tip is very simple. Here is the summary.<br />
<br />
1. Eat breakfast within an hour of waking up (preferably within 30 mins)<br />
2. Eat Protein Rich breakfast (at least 40%)<br />
3. Drink more water and more often.<br />
