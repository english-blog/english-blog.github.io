This is not a complete book, but a booklet. With this content, the author could have easily expanded into hundreds of pages. But, he wanted to make his point precisely in a short text - The Power of Thoughts. This is a much written upon subject in the market now. We could easily find hundreds of good books and thousands of junk books on this subject. This book, by James Allen is the pioneer to all of them. Even after so many decades this book is still being studied by most of the personal development gurus around the world. This book is being recommended again and again by many of my favorite authors.<br />
<br />
This book is not under copyright law. The eBook / Audio book versions are available for free in the internet. Feel free to pick up the version that suits you and spend roughly 30 mins to read or 45 mins to listen. Trust me, you won't regret it - if you read it with open mind. Yeah. That's gonna be tough for many people with preconceived idea about life. If you find yourself in that situation where you could not appreciate or understand the concepts discussed in this booklet, please read this book again in a month or after six months. But, please keep reading until you get the message in to your mind.<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
"A man is literally what he thinks" - his character being the complete sum of all his thoughts.</blockquote>
Everything that you see in the world was once a thought in someone's mind. Persisted thoughts coupled with actions, manifests itself in the real world. I can understand this from a scientist/engineer's perspective - You have a concept for a product or a structure in mind, work towards it, until it becomes a reality. Simple. But, James Allen claims more than that. Any man's current situation, being happy or unhappy, being rich or poor, his external circumstances that he can control or out of his control - were the direct results of the the thoughts harbored in his mind. He claims that we could control our inner character and the outer circumstances by thinking right thoughts and eliminating wrong thoughts.<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
"Blessedness; not material possessions, is the measure of right thoughts; wretchedness, not lack of material possessions, is the measure of wrong thoughts."</blockquote>
Like a gardener protecting his plants from weeds, we must continuously monitor and protect ourselves from wrong thoughts. He explains this with the examples of rich and poor, oppressed and the oppressors etc. He goes on to explain how thoughts affect our health and the body and the importance of having good thoughts. He also stresses the importance of having a purpose to fill your mind with the good thoughts about achieving that purpose. Even if you don't believe in Life's Purpose concept, he urges us to do whatever we do in a perfect faultless manner. Make that as a point to gather your thoughts.<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
"Until thought is linked with purpose, there is no intelligent accomplishment"</blockquote>
This book is clear on the concept that it tries to teach, but lacks the "how to" portion of it. James Allen says "Aimlessness is vice", to a world where most of the people do not know what they want. He does not give the instructions to conceive a purpose or to maintain good thoughts in minds. I think, if he had included those instructions in his book or at least give a pointer to those instructions, this would be a one stop book for all your personal development needs. There is no such thing right?.<br />
<br />
Please do read this book and grow in your life !<br />
