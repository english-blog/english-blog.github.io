<!--        <br/>Should I really write a review for Robin Sharma's book?. His name stands better than the best book-review anyone could write for his book. Hmm... let me share some of the insights that are spread throughout this book. This book packs 15 yrs of his leadership advisory experience, which was once a closely guarded secret. Robin tried to make this book interesting by using the story of an Iraq war vet Blake Davis.<br/> -->

<!--        <br/>A Song from rock band U2 kept playing in my mind, when I sit in a comfy sofa and wander what to do next. This is not new for me, I do this very often. Somehow today, I felt like Tom Hanks in "Cast Away". Yeah.. really.. What do you call a guy who is wearing a week old dirty lungi and a brand new yellow colour Reebok T-Shirt supporting "Chennai Super Kings", has not brushed till 10.30 AM, has no wallet, has no mobile phone, and hungry?. Hmm.. that's me, today March 24, 2010.<br/> -->

Everyone in the apartment 505 is still sleeping undisturbed, as usual. Prem snoozes the alarm without even opening his eyes. He came back from office at 1.30 AM last night (morning?). For the past three weeks, he has been working like hell and still enjoys the work !!!<br/> -->

<!--        <br/>Science says that its a side effect of few chemicals like oxytocin, vasopressin, dopamine, serotonin etc. If the release of these hormones is blocked, our LOVE fades away...Oops!!!... In other words, scientists can make two people fall in love with an injection?...(Cupid becomes jobless?). They can even find the exact love-genes of the individuals and produce specific chemicals to attract that specific person... Who knows, it could even become the fastest, easiest and safest way to fall in love, in this fast paced life...Scary and sounds more like a next century sci-fi movie...<br/> -->
