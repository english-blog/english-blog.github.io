<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TWry6f6WVJs/Uey7cdGXsXI/AAAAAAAAViw/nnd8WZ4-xBo/s1600/money_mastery_audio.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="326" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-TWry6f6WVJs/Uey7cdGXsXI/AAAAAAAAViw/nnd8WZ4-xBo/s400/money_mastery_audio.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>

Principle Based Money Management - The keywords which attracted me towards this audio book. With most of my income going towards the mortgages and loan EMI's, I thought I was pretty bad financially and wanted to manage the expenses in a well planned manner. The eventual search in internet made me to listen to this audio book.<br />
<br />
Audio books are usually the same printed books read by the author or a specialized voice over artists. This book is very different. It's like a play. They chose three characters Joyce &amp; Mark - the couples who earn well enough, but still struggling to make the ends meet, and a Genie character who helps them to plan their finances. It is, as if you are watching a couple implement the principles discussed in the audio CD. They take the typical examples of the spending habits of men and women and let the couple discuss and come to the conclusion about which are unnecessary expenses. I did not get bored to listen to this entire Audio CD and I hope it will be the same for you.<br />
<br />
There was a financial assessment test in the beginning of the Audio CD. 
You need to assign yourself scores from 0 - 4 for 12 questions. Based on
 the marks, you will know where you stand financially. My result shows 
that I was financially fit. Nothing to worry about and keep doing what I
 was doing. I felt much better after the test (even though, nothing 
changed). <br />
<br />
One surprising aspect is that - this is a very old Audio CD, but still relevant to date. In one of the examples of marketing &amp; emotional spending, the character Mark says "<i>There is a new TV in the market. It comes with a Remote. Why should I get up from the couch to change the channels?. Let's get that !</i>". I was like, "What the f**k?. How old is this CD?. Am I listening to decades old CD?". I laughed at myself, but kept on listening. It was interesting. I knew some of the principles discussed in this Audio CD and some are new. Here are the 10 principles.<br />
<br />
1. Spending is Emotional<br />
2. When you track it, you control it<br />
3. Saving is delayed spending<br />
4. Power down your debt, power up your fortune<br />
5. Know the rules<br />
6. The rules are always changing<br />
7. Always look at the big picture<br />
8. Organizing your finances enables the creation of additional wealth<br />
9. Understanding Taxation enables you to retain more of your money<br />
10. Money in motion creates more money<br />
<br />
I loved the principles 4 &amp; 9. I love the idea of paying up the debts as well as building a fortune, a little by little at the same time. This is similar to the concepts discussed in "<a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2011/11/automatic-millionaire-powerful-one-step.html" target="_blank">The Automatic Millionaire</a>" book by David. I will start building the Emergency Fund. The 9th principle is something that I overlooked for many years. I could have saved thousands of rupees every year on taxes. Not anymore. I am going to do a complete analysis of Taxation Model in India for Salaried Individuals and max out the tax savings for this financial year. I will blog about it as well to help others.</div>
<br />
Oops. I forgot to mention that this Audio CD comes with a software and workbook to plan your budget. Even, if you are wealthy right now, you may want to listen to this Audio CD in your free time. It may give you new ideas. Seriously, I am thinking about starting a bank :)<br />

I used to watch a lot of videos, audios related to personal development / self help genre. I used to be passive so far. (i.e) simply watching or listening. In recent times, I decided to follow along and act upon the concepts discussed by those personal development gurus. I begin to explore so much into myself and decided to blog about it. I am not going to blog about every little video/audio. I will post only about the stuff which inspires me. So, if any one of these blog posts help at least one of you, the purpose of this blog is fulfilled.:)<br />

<br />
By experience I know that, given the same requirement for a brand new application - no two architects design it with the same architecture (technology choice, platform, frameworks, patterns etc). How can there be a definite "97 things" that every software architects should know?. That too is a collective wisdom from the experts?. Those were the question popped into my mind when I picked this book from library. I read it completely to understand it.<br />
<br />
If you are a Tech Lead, transitioning to perform the Architect role in any project, then you should read this book to get the general idea behind software architecture. This book is a collection of two page articles from many software architects. Many architects contributed multiple articles to this book. All of these articles touch upon a specific case or feature of software architecture. None of these article discuss in detail about any specific item. Much like free blog posts. When I see a book with a title like this, I expect more in-depth analysis or case study of software architecture. I am disappointed in this front. If you are already an architect, this book would be a good casual read.<br />
<br />
Imagine you being in a room with a bunch of well experienced architects, having a casual chat about software architecture with no definite agenda. How would that look like?. Lots and lots of valuable information about software architecture, as well as some conflicting or possibly heated discussions among the architects on specific areas or ways of implementation. Right?. This book exactly simulates that discussion, except that every architect is given two pages for an article and no one can interrupt the other. I would suggest to read this book, when you have free time and don't take any of the suggestions blindly. None of the approaches discussed here works in all cases. Use this book to know, how other architects may think in a specific case and use your common sense to come up with the approach for the problem in hand.<br />
<br />
Some of my favorite articles are:<br />
<br />
Don't put your resume ahead of the requirements - Nitin Borwankar<br />
<br />
Chances are, your biggest problem isn't technical - Mark Ramm<br />
<br />
Everything will ultimately fail - Micheal Mygard<br />
<br />
It's never too early to think about performance - Rebecca Parsons<br />
<br />
If you design it, you should be able to code it - Mike Brown<br />
<br />
Give Developers Autonomy - Philip Nelson<br />
<br />
Pattern Pathology - Chad LaVigne<br />
<br />
Focus on Application Support &amp; Maintenance - Mncedesi Kasper<br />
<br />
The Business Vs The Angry Architect - Chad LaVigne<br />
<br />
Being in the software industry for 9 yrs and having the privilege to work with multiple clients in multiple projects across multiple locations in the world, I can resonate strongly with the above articles. For each of the articles, I can site a project/application from my experience - for not so efficient design. Every time I raise my voice against these inefficient work, either I will be silenced in the name of "cost effective solution" or I will be kicked out of the project (Yes. Seriously, it does happen even now). I am not being mean here, I can site many more awesome designs and appreciations as well. <br />
<br />
I understand that the role of an architect is like a bridge between business and technology. For some unknown reason or by natural instinct, I weigh technology more than business. I want all I create, to be perfect at the time of creation. I had the complete freedom in couple of projects so far. The "REST services" for AMEX iPhone App and the AMEX Blackberry App. Though there were existing technology limitations, I did not do any architectural tradeoff in that project. I was so happy with the implementation. You know what?. The technology, platform and the framework of the "REST services" changed within two years after I left AMEX. <br />
<br />
I would like to thanks some of the architects, who helped me to mature my understanding of software architecture, in the order that I worked with them.<br />

<b>Theist:</b> God's purpose is your purpose.<br />
<b>Agnostic:</b> Should there be a purpose?. I don't mind. <br />
<b>Atheist:</b> There is no purpose to your life. You just exist.<br />
<br />
[Below four paragraphs are my life experiences. You can skip to the next section, if you want to]<br />
<br />
For a brief period during my childhood, I was a <b>theist</b>. More than love for god, it's a Friday routine in my home to stand in front of the Hindu gods and recite Gayathri Mantra. I was encouraged to talk to god and even ask anything that I want. I never got anything from God anyway. When my little brain started thinking rationally, there were many questions in my mind around god, religion and pretty much everything else in this world. I did ask everyone I know, about religion &amp; god and did not get any satisfactory answer. I transitioned myself to an <b>agnostic</b>. I was there for a while.<br />
<br />
Slowly over the years, my beliefs were strengthened with lots of observations. When I become an <b>atheist</b>, it was such a exhilarating freedom, feeling on top of the world. When everyone else I know feared god in one way or other (during my school days), I was the only one - fearless. The downside is that I did not respect anyone (elders, teachers etc), started doing nonsensical things (going to temple and spit on idols - just to prove my friends that I don't fear God - I think during sixth grade) and during the adolescent years, quickly acquired all the unhealthy habits that you can think of. I was leading a carefree, take-it-easy lifestyle, throughout my college days. <br />
<br />
Then I met Sofia, in the corporate environment - who eventually become a close family friend. I call her, my sister. Would you believe that I quit smoking &amp; drinking in one day?. Yes. Such was her influence on me. She showed me the importance of having a good interpersonal relationship with everyone, respecting other's beliefs, having my own personal values to live by etc. I changed drastically, but not completely. I would call myself a <b>mature atheist</b>, who has a personal value system to live by.<br />
<br />
I call these phases (theist, agnostic, atheist etc) in my life as contexts though which I try to understand life. I would like to fit myself into as many contexts as possible and perceive life from different angles. I am willing to undergo a context against my belief system, just to experience the other side. I never thought about doing this, until I read Steve's blog. I accidentally read this article "<a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2005/01/how-to-discover-your-life-purpose-in-about-20-minutes/" target="_blank">How to Discover Your Life Purpose in About 20 Minutes</a>" by <a href="http://www.stevepavlina.com/about-steve-pavlina.htm" target="_blank">Steve Pavlina</a> and decided to try it.<br />
<br />
<b>How to identify the purpose of your life?</b><br />
<br />
Steve Pavlina suggests the below steps to identify your purpose in about 20 minutes.<br />
<ol>
<li>Take out a blank sheet of paper or open up a word processor.</li>
<li>Write at the top, “What is my true purpose in life?”</li>
<li>Write an answer (any answer) that pops into your head. It doesn’t have to be a complete sentence. A short phrase is fine.</li>
<li>Repeat step 3 until you write the answer that makes you cry. This is your purpose.</li>
</ol>

That's it. Sounds very simple. The time taken will vary, depending on the awareness level of the people. I took about 90 minutes to complete this exercise. I fell into the low-awareness category. Hmm...</div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
<br /></div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
When I started, I decided that I will write everything that comes to my mind, however silly, wild, nonsensical they are. Actually there were many of them. he he he. Here is how my list of purposes started ...</div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">

It was more like a To-Do list, rather than the purpose of my whole existence. I did not feel any emotion or resonate with any of the ideas. After an hour in to this exercise, I felt the urge to stop it and sleep. It was 3 AM in the morning. I told myself that I will not sleep until I complete this exercise. In one hour, I wrote about 60 items and none of them resonate with my emotions. I kept thinking and squeezing my mind for more. I kept writing whatever that comes to my mind. The 63rd item I wrote was, "<i>Finish off this exercise and sleep well</i>" - WTF?. Is this the purpose of my life?. I laughed hard at this item. This is the first emotion I experienced in this exercise so far. I felt that I am too tired to continue, but persisted for another 20 minutes. </div>

A simple thought came to my mind. Suddenly, I could feel the gush of freshness flowing to my eyes (the kind you get, when drinking Redbull during long night drives). I could hear my heart beat. I felt very fresh and started writing paragraphs after paragraphs. The Yurekha moment!... This was strange. I never felt this feeling before for a simple thought. It was item 73 and the the thought is this...</div>

We are not like shaving razors or sanitary napkins. Created for a purpose, use and throw. C'mon guys. We are human beings, capable of doing multiple things efficiently at the same time. There were many questions &amp; dialogues happening in my mind around 3.30 AM in the morning...</div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
</div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
Why should we choose only one item as the purpose of our lives, when we are exceptionally good at multiple things?.&nbsp;</div>

What restricts us?.&nbsp;</div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
Can there be more than one purpose to our lives at the same time?</div>
<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
Can there be different purposes at different stages of our lives?</div>

These questions resonates with what I am. If I look back into my life, I was too much into Bodybuilding at sometime. Few months later, I was into Poetry and did not workout at all. Few months later, I was into blogging and then into reading books, into traveling, into raw vegan lifestyle etc. Sometimes, it is exclusive and sometimes multiple items together. That is how I was and I am. How can I choose only one of them as my purpose in my life. It's not fair. I would not be living completely, if I choose to ignore many other interests for one interest.</div>

I can be a writer, poet, photographer, bodybuilder, raw vegan, entrepreneur, angel investor, social activist, politician etc., at some point in my life and do it exceptionally good. I can be the master of all trades that I get into. So, I can define my life's purpose as,</div>

OK. I identified my purpose in my life. To be precise, I had written down the mission statement of my life. What changes now?. A simple paradigm shift in the thought process !.

<!--        <br/>I have been watching the Indian Media (TV, Newspapers, Magazines etc) recent days and I am absolutely irritated to the core about thousands of "fairness cream" advertisements played the media every minute of the day. What's wrong with being dark?. Why do you (fairness cream companies) want to change my skin color?. Why even the well-educated Indians wants to have a fairer skin?. Initially, it was targeted only at women. Now, men too. C'mon guys. Build your body and stamina. <i>Your skin color does not matter, in your most important moment of manliness</i>. Trust me!.<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/darkisbeautiful" imageanchor="1" style="clear: left; float: left; margin-bottom: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" target="_blank"><img border="0" height="400" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-KaS0L7ApS1g/UbKrPHoVgCI/AAAAAAAAVds/3s-GuBn7zzk/s400/Dark_Is_Beautiful.jpg" width="280" /></a></div>
I was born into a Dravidian family in Southern India few years (?) back. By the term Dravidian, I refer to the ethnic group which lives in South India for thousands of years. This group includes Tamils, Telugus, Kannadigas, Malayalis, Tuluvas, Kurukhs, Kondavas, Kondhas and Gondis. They speak dravidian languages. All of them were dark. No exceptions. That dark skin helped us to survive &amp; stay healthy in the tropical climate. Back then, skin color was never considered as a component of beauty!. <br />
<br />
Then comes a series of invasions by white skinned people up to the latest British (lets not get into the controversial Indo-Aryan Invasion). The races gets mixed up and the people fall into a full spectrum of skin colors. There are many psychological/economical reasons to treat fairer skin superior to darker one. I can site couple of them.<br />
<br />
<b>1. Economic Status</b>: Working class people spent most of their time under sun and retained the dark color and the wealthy people tend to be a bit fairer. (Don't think about white. They were just a bit fairer).<br />
<br />
<b>2. Social Status</b>: Due to the caste systems and the extended British rule, white/fairer people always got a very high social status in the society. During this period, the minds of millions of Indians were influenced by the image that fair skin signifies superiority, dominance, and power, while dark skin represents the weaker, inferior masses.<br />
<br />
... and there are 100s of other reasons. This preference for a fairer skin is prevalent in many other countries as well.<br />
<br />
<b>History of fairness creams in India:</b><br />
<br />
Hindustan Lever Limited launched "Fair &amp; Lovely" in 1978, exploiting the Indian obsession with fairer skin tone. It is called the mother of all fairness creams in India. Now, the same product is selling in 38 countries worldwide, generating most of the income from South Asia. The current market is flooded with so many international/local brands. Neverthless, all fairness cream advertisements are based on the mantra, "<i>If you buy this fairness product, you will make your family proud, you will look beautiful, and you will secure a wonderful husband</i>" - What an insult to the Indian Women?.<br />
<br />
Just a thought - What would have happened, if these products were launched during British Empire?. "<i>How dare you want Indians look like British?</i>"... ha ha ha ha... Who knows, next "Fair &amp; Lovely" commercial can come up with this scheme - "<i>We got fairer and we got our freedom</i>".<br />
<br />
<b>What's Next?</b><br />
<br />
Yes. The most awaited product of the millennium - "Clean &amp; Dry Intimate Wash" - <b><i>To clean &amp; whiten your Vagina</i></b>. Yeah. You read it right. To make your vagina fairer. The new mantra - "<i>No one will f*ck you, if you have a dark vagina</i>". Don't they know that we are already hundred billion?. I could not stop laughing at this commercial. Here is the commercial.<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<object class="BLOGGER-youtube-video" classid="clsid:D27CDB6E-AE6D-11cf-96B8-444553540000" codebase="http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0" data-thumbnail-src="http://img.youtube.com/vi/9Tx9vVVMWw0/0.jpg" height="360" width="480"><param name="movie" value="http://youtube.googleapis.com/v/9Tx9vVVMWw0&source=uds" /><param name="bgcolor" value="#FFFFFF" /><param name="allowFullScreen" value="true" /><embed width="480" height="360"  src="http://youtube.googleapis.com/v/9Tx9vVVMWw0&source=uds" type="application/x-shockwave-flash" allowfullscreen="true"></embed></object>&nbsp;</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
Not Enough?. How about this. "18 Again" - <b><i>A Vaginal Tightening and 
Rejuvenating Gel</i></b>. Yeah. The women in the advertisement sings "<i>I feel like a virgin</i>", in front of her parents.&nbsp; Amazing. Isn't it?. There is no single cream on the market that can take wrinkles out of your face. If there is, there would not be wrinkles on old Hollywood Actresses or Rich women or Wives of Billionaires. I can't imagine how an external cream applied on the skin can make the vaginal muscles contract?. I seriously don't have a clue - How Indian women will respond to this product.</div>

<br />
My suggestion is this - Please don't let them dictate, how should you look, how should you smell, how should you dress, over or under. It's your body. You know the basics to keep it clean. That's more than enough. Let your mantra be - "<i>Clean &amp; Healthy</i>". Please don't imagine yourself in some one else's body. No one in the world worths it.<br />
<br />
Your skin color is a gift from your parents. It's a symbol of the society, place and culture you belong to. Dark or White. Feel proud about it !. <br />

<br />
The more I research about natural lifestyle, the more I come to know. The recent one is "Oil Pulling". I am excited !..<br />
<br />
<b>What is Oil Pulling?</b><br />
<br />
It's an ancient Ayurvedic practice for maintaining perfect oral health. As soon as you wake up in the morning, take a table spoon of sesame oil in your mouth and swish it around inside your mouth slowly for 15-20 mins. The Sesame Oil will turn into milky white liquid. Spit that out. Wash your mouth with water. That's all. Simple. Isn't it?.<br />
<br />
<b>Things to take care:</b>
<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Do it slowly for the full 20 minutes. It takes time for the Oil to mix with saliva and start the cleansing process. You can read or do any other activity while oil pulling.</li>
<li>Be conscious, NOT to swallow the liquid while swishing it inside the mouth.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Sesame Oil is recommended in Ayurvedic text. The recent studies says that sunflower oil is also equally good. Many people love to do oil pulling with Coconut Oil also. You can try with different oils. Just make sure that it is cold pressed and extra virgin.</li>
<li>If your jaws pain after the oil pulling session, you are doing it too vigorously. Slow down.</li>
</ul>
<br />
<b>Benefits of Oil Pulling:</b><br />
<br />
The most immediate one that you will notice in a weeks time is whiter teeth and free from bad breath. I am doing this for the past one week and I could already see my teeth getting whiter. Though there is not much of scientific study or clinical trials with oil pulling, there is a compelling collection of data from peoples testimonials (highly unreliable, but there are too many to simply discard). Below is a list of some of the most common conditions people have reported that respond to oil pulling.<br />
<ul>
<li>Acne</li>
<li>Allergies</li>
<li>Arthritis</li>
<li>Asthma</li>
<li>Back and Neck Pain (???)</li>
<li>Bad Breath</li>
<li>Bronchitis</li>
<li>Chronic Fatigue</li>
<li>Colitis</li>
<li>Crohn's Disease</li>
<li>Constipation</li>
<li>Dental Cavities</li>
<li>Dermatitis</li>
<li>Diabetes (Wow !!!)</li>
<li>Eczema</li>
<li>Hemorrhoids</li>
<li>Hypertension</li>
<li>Insomnia (WTF?)</li>
<li>Migraine Headaches</li>
<li>Mucous Congestion</li>
<li>Peptic Ulcers</li>
<li>PMS</li>
<li>Periodontal Disease</li>
<li>Bleeding Gums</li>
<li>Sinusitis</li>
<li>Tooth Abscess</li>
</ul>
I have read a whole bunch of articles about ayurvedic notion of mouth being linked with other organs of the body. They claim that the perfect oral health helps to cure many diseases of the body. There are evidences and testimonials as well. But some how I am not convinced with the idea. If you have any one of those, please try oil pulling for few months (I would suggest 6 months) and let me know, if the symptoms are reduced.<br />
<br />
<b>Why did I start doing Oil Pulling?</b><br />
<br />
After moving back to India, there were quite a big change to my raw vegan diet. I traveled a lot and missed a lot of meals during that time. I missed lunches in office due to work. I could not get Good Spinach for Smoothies. The greens available here are too heavy for smoothies. I was surviving mostly on fruits &amp; vegetables only. I know, I need to get back on track. Currently, I am researching Indian raw vegan recipes.<br />
<br />
Among all these, One of my tooth in the front lower jaw started bleeding a little regularly during brushing. Out of nowhere, I got to know about Oil Pulling and I started immediately. Believe me or not, the bleeding stopped on the third day !!!. I will continue to do oil pulling as much as I can and post a follow-up blog after few months.<br />
<br />
This is a very simple and cheap therapy. There is no harm in trying this. Please try for a week at least !<br />

<!--        <br/><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
<div style="text-align: center;">
</div>
I came back from UK recently and have to stay in my friend's home which has only Indian Toilet (Squatting Type). When I was using Indian Toilet - Whooooshhh... the whole business took less than 2 minutes and it was effortless. I normally take 5 - 10 minutes while using a Western Toilet. Once I moved to my own apartment which has Western Toilet (Sitting Type), going to the bathroom was not a breeze anymore. That triggered this research about the natural human defecating postures.<br />
<br />
It's not that I am new to Indian Toilets. I was using it from my childhood. I started using Western Toilets about 9 years ago. Only when I got a chance to use the Indian and Western, one after the other - I could realize the difference. Have a look at the below diagram which shows the Anal-Rectal Angle, while sitting and squatting. I don't need to explain which one would be a better posture for this job.<br />

<b>History of Western Toilets:</b></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
Have you ever noticed that children instinctively squat to defecate?. In the&nbsp;absence&nbsp;of toilets, we squat to defecate. Isn't it?. Our ancestor performed their daily morning routing by squatting for thousands of years. During 19th century, with the advent of indoor plumbing in UK, the sitting type toilets were installed in many houses and considered as the improved way of defecating and praised for creativity. Though the incompleteness and additional strain was obvious, no one questioned it, because it was used by the Queen Victoria for many decades. Earlier this sitting type was reserved only for the royals and the disabled.</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
Since British Empire was the most powerful and industrially advanced, the rest of the European countries, Australia and North America adopted the sitting type toilets used by the British Royals. They didn't want to appear less civilized.</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<b>A Clinical Study of Sitting versus Squatting:</b></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
In 2002,&nbsp;an Iranian radiologist, Dr. Saeed Rad, published a study which compared the effectiveness of sitting versus squatting for evacuation. Thirty subjects participated in the study – 21 male, 9 female – ranging in age from 11 to 75 years. Each patient received a barium enema so the internal mechanics of evacuation could be recorded on an X-Ray image. Each patient was studied in both the squatting and the sitting positions.</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
Using squat toilets, all the subjects reported "complete" evacuation. "Puborectalis relaxation occurred easily and straightening of the rectum and anal canal facilitated evacuation. The anal canal became wide open and no folding was noticed in the terminal rectum." In the sitting position, "a remarkable folding was created in the terminal rectum predisposing it to rectocele formation, and puborectalis relaxation was incomplete." All the subjects reported that elimination felt "incomplete" in the sitting position.</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
Dr. Rad concluded that the use of the squat toilet "is a more comfortable and efficient method of bowel evacuation" than the sitting toilet.</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both;">
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<b>Advantages of Indian Toilets:</b></div>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li>Makes elimination faster, easier and more complete. This helps prevent "fecal stagnation," a prime factor in colon cancer, appendicitis and inflammatory bowel disease.</li>
<li>Protects the nerves that control the prostate, bladder and uterus from becoming stretched and damaged.</li>
<li>Securely seals the ileocecal valve, between the colon and the small intestine. In the conventional sitting position, this valve is unsupported and often leaks during evacuation, contaminating the small intestine.</li>
<li>Relaxes the puborectalis muscle which normally chokes the rectum in order to maintain continence.</li>
<li>Uses the thighs to support the colon and prevent straining. Chronic straining on the toilet can cause hernias, diverticulosis, and pelvic organ prolapse.</li>
<li>A highly effective, non-invasive treatment for hemorrhoids, as shown by published clinical research.</li>
<li>For pregnant women, squatting avoids pressure on the uterus when using the toilet. Daily squatting helps prepare one for a more natural delivery.</li>
</ol>
<b>What's Next:</b><br />
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li>Install an Indian toilet (or any eastern type squatting toilet) in your home. (Best &amp; Recommended)</li>
<li>Use a Squat Toilet Utility like <a href="http://www.squattypotty.com/Articles.asp?ID=267" target="_blank">Squatty Potty</a>.You don't need to pay so much for a simple device. There are cheaper alternatives available in market. Just google. I never used this personally. So, I cannot comment on this. Just try, if you cannot do option 1. <a href="http://www.squattypotty.com/Articles.asp?ID=267" target="_blank"><br /></a></li>

	<span>11 May 2013</span> &raquo; <a href="/2013/05/11/you-have-changed-after-marriage/">You have changed after marriage !</a>
<!--        <br/><div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;" trbidi="on">
<div style="text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: left;">
I thought I will never hear these words in my marriage. I feel more loved and love her more passionately than before. I started hearing these words from my love in couple of occasions. Very first time I heard that, I justified her and convinced her that I will try to be the same as before. But, when I hear this the second time, I felt that a serious before/after analysis is required to get this thought out of her mind and make her understand, how to make things work for each other without ignoring the changes. Hmmm... this phase seems inevitable in every marriage.&nbsp;</div>
</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<i><b>Did I really change after marriage?</b></i></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
Yes. I did. While dating, I was a careless rogue and a romantic poet who cares about only one thing - Love. Nothing else. Never bothered to go to work. Never bothered about my career. Never cared about my finances. Side effects of dopamine and serotonin?.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
After marriage, I have a home and a whole bunch of expenses to take care. I had to be very proper with the finances. I need to be regular to work. I cannot be care free anymore. Suddenly, going out required planning. Going to theaters means reading reviews about the movies and choose it wisely (?) etc.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<i><b>Is it a positive change?</b></i></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
Yes. It is. I became more organized and become good at planning. I used to spend couple of hours in the morning for myself. To make that time for me again, I started waking up 6 AM every day. I started reading a lot of books again. I started concentrating on diet and exercise. I stopped eating junk foods and going to parties. I became a raw vegan. I spent most of the evenings and the weekends with her.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
What confused me is that I became a better person, but she felt that we grow apart !!!</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<b><i>The Analysis:</i></b></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
I have to find out what is happening with us.But, I don't know where to start. Simply, I listed down the activities I like to do and asked her to do the same thing. Once we had two lists, I plotted them in a Venn diagram. Here is what our "Relationship Venn Diagram" looks like.<br />
<br />
<br /></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--FIuJDF7MZY/UY2qaOvAKDI/AAAAAAAAVY0/9RD9d-W5HJ4/s1600/Relationship-Venn-Diagram.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="480" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/--FIuJDF7MZY/UY2qaOvAKDI/AAAAAAAAVY0/9RD9d-W5HJ4/s640/Relationship-Venn-Diagram.jpg" width="640" /></a></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
<b><i>The Findings:</i></b></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">
</div>
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li>We both have a set of activities that we love to do together.</li>
<li>We do have a disjointed set of unrelated&nbsp;activities&nbsp;that we love to do with/without the other.</li>
<li><b><span style="color: #cc0000;">We cannot simply do the common activities forever, no matter how deep in love we are.</span></b></li>
<li>We must spend time on other activities with/without the better half.</li>
<li><i>The success of the marriage depends on how efficiently we allocate time on common &amp; uncommon activities.</i></li>
</ol>
I am glad that we did this exercise last night. We will try to add more things to our common interests and give enough time &amp; space for the other person to pursue his/her own interests. We will make sure that the other person is actively engaged in some activity while, we do our own activities. Simply plotting the Venn Diagram provided such an insight and initiated a thought process which helped us to look at the same things differently. I wish every couple does this exercise and keeps the list updated every six months.<br />
<b><i><br /></i></b>
<b><i>Please do this if you are in a relationship, it helps you both !..</i></b></div>

What is God?. Why do I keep stumbling upon books which discusses the concept of God. The more I declare that I don't believe in god, the more books I get to read about God. I don't think much about 'God'. But when I do, I got lost in a very lengthy monologue.I thank the author Jesse Bering for a different insight to the God concept.<br />
<br />
This book, "The God Instinct" uses hard science to show that God is not a delusion, but a sophisticated cognitive illusion.<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Success for our human ancestors must have depended on being able to get inside the minds of those who they lived with, second guess them, anticipate where they were going, help them if they needed it, challenge them or manipulate them. To do this, they had to develop brains that would deliver a story about what it's like be another person from the inside.</blockquote>
<b>Theory of Mind</b> is the ability to think, what the other person might be thinking about us or about anything else at any specific time. This developed cognitive ability helped the small group of humans survive and grow in numbers. This ability protected the group by identifying the anti-social elements in the group and removing them. This ability also alerts the individuals that they are being watched for their anti-social activities by the other members. Development of languages and human gossips led the anti-social act of a member being remembered and gossiped, long after it was done - which affected that member's reproductive success. This awareness of being watched eventually led to the belief of being watched by an supernatural agent or God!.<br />
<br />
If you still cannot conceive the idea, think about this. You are in a shopping mall and you see a person wearing atrociously colorful, old fashioned dress and you asked yourself, what on earth these people were thinking when they looked in the mirror - you have a theory of mind in perfect working order. <br />
<br />
How humans developed this ability in first place?. Why on earth that only human's brain were rewired to have this capability?. Possibly due to cooking? and the abundance of nourishment the human brain received helped to grow bigger and form more neural connections? and one of those connections happened to have this ability?. God only knows... he he he he...<br />
<br />
<b>Signs </b>- We see other people as more than just their bodies, we also tend to see natural events as more than just natural events. We seem to think that there are subtle messages, signs or cues that god or other supernatural agent is trying to communicate to us - often to us alone. The belief that each and every individual is being watched by god naturally leads us to think that god must communicate to us about our immoral acts and show us the right way. Since this communication must be unique to us, our brain tries to decipher so-called hidden messages from very ordinary natural events. <br />
<br />
Not all of us expects to see god's messages. People with autism will not be able to decipher the hidden subtle messages in natural events. Does this mean that God cannot communicate to these people?. On the other side, people with paranoid schizophrenia see persoanl signs and messages in nearly everything, living most of their lives in hallucinations. Also, do children has this ability to read messages?. Not until their brain is matured and populated with the beliefs. <br />
<br />
These are just two of the many concepts discussed in this book. This book is from an evolutionary psychologist. So, expect a lot of clinical trials, thought experiments, quotes from other authors, snippets from science and psychology journals. This book keeps your interests alive till the last page. You would definitely want to discuss or tell these concepts to someone you know. My perspective about God is becoming more clear and more convincing now. Of course with the few unanswered, but very important questions. I am happy that I am approaching so called God or a Cognitive Illusion, one step at a time.<br />
<br />
Thank you Jesse Bering.<br />

A Vegan book review from a voracious meat eater?. Yeah. I had the assumption that meat eaters are stronger and have more endurance than vegans. I always assumed that vegans lack protein from plant based diet. Until, I saw this <a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2013/01/cooked-food-vs-raw-vegan-food.html">video</a>&nbsp;and heard that the author of this book Brendan Brazier, is an Ironman athlete, who lives on 100% plant based diet. Whoohooh... (<i>An Ironman Triathlon is a race consisting of a 2.4-mile (3.86 km) swim, a 112-mile (180.25 km) bicycle ride and a marathon 26.2-mile (42.2 km) run, raced in that order and without a break.</i>)<br />
<div>
<br /></div>
<div>
A raw vegan food eater, Brendan can complete this race within 9 hours (on par with the worlds best athletes, who eat meat and supplements). This intrigued me so much that I decided to try this diet for three months. Let's measure this book's claims after three months. Let's see the gist of what this is book has in store for us.</div>
<br />
We all know about stress. Right?. The very first section of the book discusses about the complimentary, uncomplimentary and production stress. He also discusses in detail on psychological, environmental and nutritional stress. Why so much details about stress in a book where we expect set of recipes?.Because, this is not a recipe book. This is a complete health book, which will transform your body, your lifestyle and assist you with the transformation process. Recipes spread across the book is to ease your transition efforts.<br />
<br />
<b>Nutritional Stress</b> - caused by food because of its unhealthy properties. Not eating the right nutrient rich food, at the right amount and at right interval, places a considerable amount of stress in our body and eventually in our mind.<br />
<br />
<b>High Net Gain Foods</b> - Another important aspect of food calories which we conveniently ignore, is the energy spent by the body to digest, assimilate and eliminate the food from our body. If you consume, 100 calories and your body spends 50 calories in the digestion process, your effective calorie consumption is 50 calories + stress on your body. All of the thrive diet recipes are high net gain foods.<br />
<br />
<b>One Step Nutrition</b> - describes the food containing nutrients already in the form usable by the body. Most of the cooked foods has the complex forms of the nutrients, which must be broken down to simpler form for the body to absorb it. Most thrive diets have simpler form. Very Important!.<br />
<br />
Complex Carbohydrates to Simple Carbohydrates<br />
Fat to Fatty Acids<br />
Protein to Amino Acids<br />
<br />
<b>Exercise for an ageless body</b> - There is no magical diet or pill which will give you the perfect body without exercises. The Thrive Diet is no exemption. Exercise is one of the best complimentary stress. When you exercise, you break down some of the cells in your body and your body regenerates when it is provided with the right nutrients. The more frequently your body regenerates, the more young you will be. Brendan suggest the natural forms of sports drinks and supplements, before, during and after the exercises. You can make all of them at home. Specific recipes for specific levels of exercises. I love it.<br />
<br />
<b>Foods &amp; Nutrients</b> - A big chapter is dedicated to explain in detail, all the nutrients your body needs (carbohydrates, protein, fat, vitamins, mineral etc), the food soruces that are rich in those nutrients and the best way to consume them. Just for this chapter, I love to keep this book as a reference in my library.<br />
<br />
<b>Vitamin B12</b> - One "beaten to death" discussion against raw foods is the unavailability of Vitamin B12 in the raw foods. Brendan suggests that B12 is available in <i>chlorella (sea plant), miso and nutritional yeast</i> and he consumes them regularly. However, the availability of these foods around the world is a big question.<br />
<br />
Some raw foodists, suggest to take vitamin supplements. I don't like medicine. So, I will not. But, I will try to eat a cup of curd / milk daily to compensate for Vitamin B12, till I get a reliable, consistent supply of natural sources of this vitamin. I am not for / against raw or cooked foods. I am looking for the perfect diet for human body. If the blend of both is the best, I will go for it. <br />
<br />
I strongly suggest everyone to read this book, even if you don't have plans to eat raw food. If you eat cooked food, you MUST know what happens to your body. Ignorance is not bliss !!!<br />
