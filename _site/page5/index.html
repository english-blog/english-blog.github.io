<b>Book:</b> 3's A Crowd<br />
<b>Author:</b> Vijay Nagaswami<br />
<b>ISBN:</b> 9381626276<br />
<b>ISBN-13:</b> 9789381626276,978-9381626276<br />

<br />
India is a place where still uttering words like ‘infidelity’ will make people roll their eyes. Affairs- irrespective of being extra-marital or pre-marital are a taboo to be talked upon. Even if someone sees you reading a book on anything to do with relationship, you will be seen as a person with some different morale. As much as we portray ourselves as very civilized and traditional group, so much of affairs keep happening around us. Every now and then a scandal or rumor arises about affairs. But as long as it doesn’t happen to us or people in our close circle, we tend to look at it as information or a juicy chunk of gossip. These affairs carry with it a lot of assumptions and myths. The very cover of the book shatters the ever told myth: “It’s common that men stray”. But who do they have affair with? I told myself, “Okay, that’s a point.”<br />
<br />
All of us tend to believe that infidelity or affair could happen only for others. Mine is a perfect relationship. But even those who face the infidelity think the same before discovering it. The point is: It might happen in any relationship or marriage. Vijay has artfully put this book together. I would call it ‘A-Z infidelity’. He has begun with how monogamy is a discipline we follow and not the nature of our species, connecting to the infidelity in history and its changes in the modern times. Another myth proven wrong is: ‘affairs are those when physical relationship involves’. Author has penned the various types of affairs and the driving factors behind them. For example, even emotional intimacy with opposite gender other than your spouse which detracts your marriage qualifies as an affair.<br />
<br />
The casual tone and stating things matter-of-fact drives home the point hitting the bull’s eye. The five hall-marks of an affair stated by Vijay would definitely make ourselves think if we are having any affair unconsciously. The book is divided into two parts: Understanding infidelity and Surviving infidelity. Time and again, Vijay keeps insisting the point: “An affair happens because a person chooses so. The counter-part is not responsible for an affair by being unattractive or any such reason.” Even perfect and happy marriages stumble upon infidelity. Apt stories illustrate every little nuance which the author tries to tell.<br />
<br />
While the first half of book analyses infidelity, second half tells you how to survive through it and emerge out successfully. ‘It happened, now how do I handle it and come out of it without throwing a tantrum’- is what the book tries to tell you. The book analyses from both the partners’ perspective without imaging anyone as villain. Taking a neutral stand, it advises both the parties the most advisable course of actions to follow. The focal point of the book is how far it is possible to revive the marriage or the relationship after the catastrophe ‘infidelity’ happens.<br />
<br />
This is not a novel or a story to criticize from literary perspective analyzing the metaphors and personifications. Definite applauds for the articulation of the rich and heavy content. Being the third book in the series ‘The New Indian Marriage’ and the first I read, there are many references to the other books in the series as well.<br />
<br />
Guess I might write this review as big as a book in an attempt to pen down my thought flow. I would recommend this book to anyone irrespective of being in relationship or not, or for that matter married or not. Whichever category you fall in, this book is going to serve you as guide on how to react and live through the trauma of infidelity. Or unfortunately, if you have already faced one then it is going to alter most of your perceptions about affairs and break a few myths which you are clinging to. And hey, wait! Do not think that you will start suspecting your partner after reading this book. It is just going to make you bond more to him/her. In author’s words: “Trust your partner, and more than that trust yourself.”<br />

<b>Book:</b> Chicken Soup For The Indian Soul: A Book Of Miracles<br />
<b>Author:</b> Raksha Bharadia, Jack Canfield, Mark Victor AndHansen<br />
<b>ISBN:</b> 9381626368<br />
<b>ISBN-13:</b> 9789381626368, 978-9381626368<br />

<br />
This is the first book I read in Chicken Soup series. The title ‘A book of miracles’ made me raise eye brows, wondering what I could expect in this book. The excerpt at back cover confirmed my guess that it’s superficial yet true incidents that happened in people’s life. Though the secret was revealed, my curiosity took over me and I found myself reading the book ardently.<br />
<br />
Sometimes you meet someone somewhere and the incident seems to have happened before. And you wonder how it is possible. You try to tell this to your friends and most of the times you get skeptic looks and mock laughs behind the back. Well, I’m a person who has experienced those. Though I have a different rationale for the miracles and coincidences, I do believe that MIRACLES DO HAPPEN IN LIFE.<br />
<br />
The very first story ‘Angelic presence’ by Seema Agarwal gave me a slight shiver. Though many of the stories are so similar to the ones which we have heard in our early days, each story never fails to widen your eyes or even make your heart skip a beat (If ardent believer in religion). And the fact that these stories being real life incidents ignited a debate between my mind and heart for many of these couldn’t be explained in the present scientific terms. Stories have been compiled and sorted under same kind and presented with an anecdote in the beginning of every part.<br />
<br />
Modern day scientists and psychiatrists may give rational explanations for many of the events which will make most of the atheists to nod their heads in approval. But there are a few occurrences which transcend all the human rationale. No ‘mind over matter’ like theories can explain those. There are a few stories which hit me like hitting the bull’s eye.<br />
<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Signs from above</li>
<ul>
<li>Angelic presence</li>
<li>The tacky label</li>
</ul>
<li>Love from beyond</li>
<ul>
<li>Basanti and Veeru2. Little Molly</li>
</ul>
<li>His saving grace</li>
<ul>
<li>Mamma, the wind carried me safe</li>
</ul>
<li>Answered prayers</li>
<ul>
<li>Mehr</li>
</ul>
<li>Everyday miracles</li>
<ul>
<li>My top five miracles</li>
<li>The miracle called Laska</li>
</ul>
<li>Divine appointment</li>
<ul>
<li>The call of Kathak</li>
</ul>
<li>The magic of faith</li>
<ul>
<li>Paint a picture of your dreams</li>
</ul>
</ul>
<br />
These ten stories stand apart and really touched my heart. You can reason many of the incidents in these stories. So what? If something from within makes things possible, name it as you like it. Let it be your own will power or faith or karma or some angelic help.<br />
<br />
Literary critic is a little difficult with respect to this particular book because it’s not penned by just one author. Simple language and brevity are the two great plus points, I would say. Even beginners in reading wouldn’t find it difficult to read. However, I came across a few difficulties. Some of the stories narrators haven’t identified themselves properly in the beginning. Couldn’t make out if the narrator is male or female in many of the instances. Either had to turn the page to find the name at the end of the story or look for any hints of self-identification in the story. It was a little disturbing and interrupted the flow. Also, I felt certain stories were categorized under a different category while it seemed to belong under a different category.<br />
<br />
The book might be a really a book of miracles for those who really believe in a supreme power while might make the agnostics scratch their chins with skepticism. And for those trying to take a double stand, this book definitely has the potential to convince you to turn a believer of miracles. You can find conviction and genuineness in all the 101 stories. I would conclude that any event and every event in life is a miracle, for I consider: “Life itself is a MIRACLE.”<br />

"<i>When the student is ready, the teacher appears</i>". Sounds superficial?. Not to me. This book was released 14 years ago and I saw this book in every book store, everyone told me that this book is awesome, but some how this book eluded me, even though I wanted to read it. I did not bother much then. In recent days, my life was not happening as I wanted it to happen. Everything was out of my control and I wanted to discipline my life. Viola... The book appears next to my bed. My room mate bought the book. So, I started reading...<br />
<br />
If you want me to write one line review, I would say, "One the best books that I have read so far".<br />
<br />
This is a self help book written like a novel. The story is so well written that you don't even feel like someone is teaching you something. Every tip that he gives, go to your sub-conscious mind without any effort. I even wondered how can so much of practical wisdom could be packed into a single book.Robin Sharma shares his wisdom with a mystical fable of a uber-successful lawyer Julian Mantle and his assitant John. Julian Mantle is the hot shot millionaire lawyer in the country. During his middle age, in one of the courtroom arguments, he gets a massive heart attack. He suddenly realizes that he has more life to live and there must be a reason for his existence. He leaves to Himalayas learns the tricks of life and comes back to US to spread the wisdom.<br />
<br />
Here is a gist of what he teaches in the book. I would suggest you read the complete book in Robin Sharma's words. He explains the seven virtues of life with a simple tale. Each character and object in the mystical fable has a meaning.<br />
<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
<i>You are sitting in the middle of a magnificient, lush, green garden. This garden is filled with the most spectacular flowers you have ever seen. The environment is supremely tranquil and silent. In the center of this garden stands a towering red light house, six stories high. Suddenly from the light house, comes out a nine-foot tall, nine-hundred pound Japanese Sumo wreslter who casually wanders into the garden.He wears nothing but a pink wire cable covering his private parts. He slips on a shily gold stopwatch, and falls to the ground with an enormous thud. The Sumo wreslter is rendered&nbsp;unconscious&nbsp;and lies there, silent and still. After a while, he awakens by the fragrance of the fresh yellow roses blooming nearby. Through the bushes at the very edge of the garden, he observes a long winding path covered by millions of sparkling diamonds. This path leads him down the road of ever lasting joy and eternal bliss.</i></blockquote>
<br />
<b>1. Master Your Mind:</b><br />
<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The garden in the fable represents your mind. Like the fresh, frangrant roses in the garden, fill your mind with pleasant, happy and positive thoughts. Good gardeners don't allow the weeds to take root in their garden. So, do not allow any negative thoughts to wander in your mind. You cannot afford the luxury of even a single thought. He gives some techniques to do that.<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><b>Heart of the Rose:</b> Pick up a fresh rose flower or a plastic one in your hand in the morning as soon as you wake. Just look at the flower, its color, its petal, its curves. Just enjoy the flower and do nothing. Initially your mind wont let you do that. It will wander into all possible directions. Do not worry. Just follow the ritual for 15 minutes or more daily. Slowly you will be able to calm down the mind. You can choose alternatives like meditation or chanting any mantras. The idea here is to spend sometime for yourself to calm down the mind in the morning.</li>
<li><b>Opposition Thinking:</b> Whenever a negative thought appears in your mind, just pause for a while and replace it with a opposite positive thoughts. For example, if you begin to think about your current debts, suddenly change your thought to something like you have more than enough money for everything you want. Initially you may feel awkward. Do not mind. Just let your imagination fly. Slowly, you will begin to notice that there are no negative thoughts and you start taking positive actions. You need to do this all the time.</li>
<li><b>The Secret of the Lake:</b> Everyone should have goals. If you dont have one in your life, sit down and think about it. One you are sure about your goals, you need to find a calm place to sit and visualize in your mind screen a movie, in which all your goals are achieved and you are experiencing eternal joy. I do it differently. As soon asI finish meditation, I close my eyes with my palms and I see nothing but darkness. I visualize my goals as a movie in that dark screen. Try !</li>
</ul>
<b>2. Follow Your Purpose:</b><br />
<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The light house in the fable represents your purpose in life. You will never be able to hit a target that you cannot see. So, figure out your goals. WRITE them down in a paper. When you do that you send a flag to your mind that these thoughts are far more important than the other 60,000 thoughts. Your mind will become acutely aware about your goals and start realizing it. This is science. You can follow the below five steps.<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><b>Picturize the outcome:</b> If you have a goal to lose weight, picturize the outcome of it. Picturize yourself being lean and fit. Do this every morning as soon as you wake up. You set the motion for the rest of your day with this visualization.</li>
<li><b>Create Positive Pressure:</b> Public pledge is one the best positive pressure for humans. Tell everyone about your goals. They will be watching you. No one wants to appear as failure among others. This positive pressure will help you to keep up with your plans for achieving your goals.</li>
<li><b>Attach a timeline:</b> To breathe life into your goals, attach a timeline to your goals. A goal that is not committed to paper is no goal at al. Buy a notebook and call that your "Dream Book". Fill tha book with your goals, desires, acheivements and the things that you want to improve. Get to know about yourself completely. Fill that book with the images of all the things that want to have or to be. Refer this book everyday.</li>
<li><b>Magic Rule of 21:</b> For a new process to install as a habit, you need to do that consequtively for 21 days. This is proven by many people over years. So, keep doing the above for 21 continous days and viola it will be a habit.</li>
<li><b>Enjoy the journey:</b> Do not fix your eyes on the destination only. Enjoy the route to your destination. Enjoy every happiness that you can while you are practizing the above.</li>
</ul>
<b>3. Practice Kaizen:</b><br />
<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The Japanese word Kaizen means constant and never ending improvement. The sumo wrestler symbolizes the constant self-improvement and personal expansion. People grow the most when they enter the Zone of the Unknown. He urges us to do the things that we fear and suggests 10 ancient rituals for radiant living. Just follow these rituals for 30 days and your life will begin to change drastically. Here are they.<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><b>Ritual of Solitute:</b> Ensure that your daily schedule includes a mandatory period of peace. Find a quiet and beautiful place to sit still in contemplation. You could do the heart of the rose technique or any other kind of meditation. The place could be a spare room inyour house, or a corner in your apartment or a natural backyard. Please make sure that you do this daily at the same time and at the same place, till it becomes a habit. Just by doing this simple ritual, your life will well balanced and you will enjoy good sleep at night. Guys - trust me. It works. I do this everyday, first thing in the morning. Please try.</li>
<li><b>Ritual of Physicality:</b> This says as you care for your body, so you care for your mind. Please take some time everyday to nourish your body with physical exercise. It could be weight training, aerobic training or yoga or simple walk around the park. Choose whichever is comfirtable for you, but persist. At least 5 hours a week is suggested.</li>
<li><b>Ritual of Live Nourishment:</b> Eat live foods. Foods that are not dead. He suggests vegetarian foods like fresh fruits, vegetables, grains etc. It may not be possible for everyone, but we could add few fruits or salads with each meal. I am finding it very difficult to eat vegetarian food, but started eating fruits after lunch. Did not see much improvement, but I could feel hungry before dinner. Otherwise, I will be full all the time.</li>
<li><b>Ritual of Abundant Knowledge:</b> This centers on the whole notion of lifelong learning and expanding your knowledge base for the benefit of yourself and those around you. Read atleast 30 minutes a day. It wil do wonders in your life. I know this very well. I read about an hour a day. Solutions to almost every problem is already in print. Just grab a good book and start reading.</li>
<li><b>Ritual of Personal Reflection:</b> Spend some time on personal introspection every evening or night. Just sit down in a silent place and write down all the actions that you did on that day and think if those activities are positive or negative. If negative, come up with an alternative course of action to correct it. Initially you may not be able to recall every event in that day. But persist. Eventually you will be able to and your behaviour would turn positive and optimistic.</li>
<li><b>Ritual of Early Awakening:</b> Rise with the sun. Taught by almost all the self help gurus. The thoughts you think, 10 minutes before you sleep and 10 minutes after you wake up have a prfound effect on your day. So, think nice and happy thoughts. Laugh even if you dont feel like. Listen to music. Watch the sun rise. Read a good book. Prepare your course of action for the rest of the day. You can achieve so much, just by this ritual.</li>
<li><b>Ritual of Music:</b> Music has the capability to soothen the raffled soul. Its one of the finest motivators. Enjoy the music you like, atleast once in a day.</li>
<li><b>Ritual of Spoken Word:</b> You can choose any mantra or positive affirmation to recite in the morning, noon and night or whenever you feel drowned in negative thoughts. Spoken affirmations are as good as written ones. You may say. "I am strong, able and calm" many times when you need to be.</li>
<li><b>Ritual of Radiant Living:</b> This ritual requires you to take daily, incremental action to build your character. You should have a set of principles/virtues to live by and take daily action to strengthen your character aligned with those principles.</li>
<li><b>Ritual of Simplicity:</b> This ritual requires you to live a simple life. Focus only on your priorities, those activities that are truly meaningful. Your life will be uncluttered, rewarding and exceptionally peaceful. This doesn't mean that you should not strive to be rich and wealthy. If that is what you want, go for it. Make sure that you spend time on actions which tops your priority list and close to your heart. Don't just chase money.</li>
</ul>
<b>4. Power of discipline:</b><br />
<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The pink wire cable which covers the private parts of the Japanese Sumo wrestler symbolizes the discipline, self control that you should have in your life. Robin says, "When you control your thoughts, you control your mind. When you control your mind, you controlyour life. Once you reach the stage of being in total control of your life, you become the master of your destiny". You slowly nurture the embryo of self discipline day by day and one day you will have enormous will power to do the things that seem impossible.<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><b>Mantras:</b> Robin stresses again on the importance of mantras/affirmations that keeps us focused on our true goals. Words have power. By repetition, you would develop self-control and indomitable will within a short period of time. The same is referred as the Ritual of Spoken Word in the previous chapter.</li>
<li><b>Vow of Silence:</b> He suggests us to go on an entire day without speaking, except for the answers to the direct questions. Whenever you feel the urge to speak, suppress it. It will help to improve your will power. Somehow, I dont buy into that concept. I am not going to try this.</li>
</ul>
<b>5. Respect Your Time:</b><br />
<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The shiny gold stopwatch symbolizes your time, the most precious commodity. "Being an excellent time manager doesnt mean that you have to become a workaholic. On the contrary, time mastery allows more time to do the things that you would love to do and the things which are meaningful to you. Time mastery leads to life mastery. Guard your time well. Remember, its a non renewable resource". Some of the things that you may do are<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><b>Ancient Rule of 20:</b> The statistics say that 80% of your success comes from the 20% of the action that you take. So, prioritize the things and spend more time on the things that bring you success and happiness. Just&nbsp;don't&nbsp;be busy being busy.</li>
<li><b>Learn to say NO:</b> Many people drift from their goals or distracted by others very often. Learning to say NO to the less important things in life, allows you to spend more time on the things that trylu matters. Don't pick up all the calls. Dont respond toevery emails. Few other practical stuff.</li>
<li><b>Deathbed Mentality:</b> I have heard this from Steve Jobs as well. "What would you do, if this is your last day in your life?" Ask this question every morning and let it decide the course of action for the entire day. I am personally not into this. If today was my last day, I would spend all the time with my love, family and friends, roam around, enjoy and have fun. I would never think about work. Is that what he suggests? I don't think so. Also, I would n't prefer to think about death every morning.</li>
</ul>
<b>6. Selflessly Serve Others:</b><br />
<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The fresh yellow roses in the garden symbolizes the most essential virtue of an enlightened living - Serving others. "The quality of your life will come down to the quality of your contribution". When you work to improve the lives of others, you indirectly elevating the life of yours. He suggests few tips to start serving others.<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><b>Random Acts of Kindness:</b> Just make sure that you do few kind actions through out your day. It could be helping the old woman cross the street, helping your&nbsp;colleague&nbsp;with a small problem, simple appreciation to a friend in need or just flashing a smile across a stranger. Just keep doing it. When you do the ritual of personal&nbsp;reflection, these random acts of kindness will soothe your soul and in no time, you will become a kind person doing big things for the society.</li>
<li><b>Give to those who Ask:</b> How many times in your life, that someone came to you for help and you were too busy to help them?. I get the point that it is not possible to help everyone else all the time. But, whenever possible take extra few minutes to help them. They will never forget your help.</li>
<li><b>Cultivate Richer Relationships:</b> Should I even describe about this technique?. Develop richer relationship with friends and family. It doesn't matter how many friends you have in life, what matters is how many of them are true &amp; rich relationship with whom you can have a belly-bursting laugh at some times for no reason. Go for it.</li>
</ul>
<b>7. Embrace the Present:</b><br />
<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space: pre;"> </span>The long winding path studded with millions of diamonds represents the final virtue of the fable. Living the Present.Happiness is the journey, not the destination. Some of the things to remember are<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li><b>Live your children's childhood:</b> The best gift you could ever give your children is your love. Show them that they are far more important than anything else in your life. Within a blink of eye, they will grow up, start their own family and leave. But then, it will be too late. One of the most precious moments in anyone's life is the time they spend with their children. Don't miss it for anything.</li>
<li><b>Practice Gratitude:</b> Be grateful for all the small things that you have in life. Even if you are bankrupt, you can be grateful for being alive, being able to think and read. When you are in a grateful mood, you mind becomes very positive and optimistic and you start doing positive actions which would bring you success in whatever you desire.</li>
</ul>
I felt like writing an entire book, for writing just this review. Whooh. This is not just a book review, but a book-let version - for those who doesn't have the time to read. I will come back to this blog post often to remind me all the virtues. Some books are meant to be read again and again. This is one of them. Get your copy and start reading !<br />

<b>Book:</b> I Have A Dream<br />
<b>Author:</b> Rashmi Bansal<br />

<br />
"I Have A Dream" is the third book in Rashmi Bansal's very successful trilogy of "Stay Hungry Stay Foolish" and "<a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2010/07/connect-dots.html" target="_blank">Connect The Dots</a>". All the three books were sold over 350,000 copies in India and translated into 8 languages. She secured a place for her in infibeam's list of <a href="http://www.infibeam.com/Books/indian-authors-writers-a.html" target="_blank">Famous Authors in India</a>. Congrats to her. In my last review about "<a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2010/07/connect-dots.html" target="_blank">Connect The Dots</a>" book, I suggested her NOT to mix Hindi and English in the English version of the book, so that the book could inspire millions of Indians who doesn't understand Hindi. But, the same continued in this book as well. Many of my North Indian friends told me that the mix of Hindi gives them the feel of locality and connection with the person, when reading. What about me who doesn't understand Hindi?. - Its irritating. I generally do not skip even a single line, while reading any book. But this trilogy from Rashmi Bansal is the exception.<br />
<br />
What do we have in this book, this time?. The inspiring story of 20 social entrepreneurs who took up a social cause and made a business out of it. Their motive is not to earn more money, but to make a difference in the lives of people around them. Most of them started small, without knowing their destination or a definite business plan. All they had in mind is to help the people. Eventually people, money and resources fell in place and they made it big. The surprising fact is that all of them are middle-class people, the average&nbsp;Indians. If they can do it, anyone of us can also do it. All we need is the patience and&nbsp;perseverance.&nbsp;This is a different version of the <a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2011/07/creative-capitalism-conversation-with.html" target="_blank">Creative Capitalism</a> - defined by Bill Gates. The large corporations should come forward to assist one of these social organisation as their means of doing good&nbsp;to the society.<br />
<br />
This book is divided in to three categories, as usual.<br />
<br />
<b>Rainmakers:</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Social enterprises which generates revenue. A new model of doing good, not mere charity. This includes a wide variety of entrepreneurs taking up a wide range of social issues. Bindeshwar Pathak - "Sulabh International" who revolutionized the sanitary situation in India, Saloni Malhotra - "DesiCrew" who setup the India's first rural BPO, Dinabandhu Sahoo - "Project Chilika" who trains the villagers in Orissa to farm the Ocean, sowing the seeds of a 'Blue Revolution', Anand Kumar - "Super 30" who coaches the poor but&nbsp;meritorious students for IIT JEE &nbsp;and Dhruv Lakra - "Mirakle Couriers" who believed in the most neglected portion of the society - the deaf. There are many other inspiring stories, some of which will even make you to cry.<br />
<br />
<b>Changemakers:</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Those who cannot just accept what is wrong and make every possible step to change the way the society functions. Anshu Gupta - "Goonj" which systematically collect, sort and deliver every scrap of waste clothing from Urban India to someone out there, to wear with pride and dignity, Trilochan Sastry - "Association for Democratic Reforms (ADR)" who raised a PIL and made the&nbsp;politicians&nbsp;to declare their assets, criminal history during elections and continues with further reforms, Arvind Kejriwal - "Parivarthan" who is an IRS officer, but secretly started a war against his own department and teaches the people to use RTI to the fullest, Bushan Punani - "Blind People's Association (BPA)" who is an MBA from IIM, but decided to see if management&nbsp;principles&nbsp;could be applied to the social sectors and create a change, which he did with BPA.<br />
<br />
<b>The Spiritual Capitalists:</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; These are highly educated guys from IIT's and IIM's who felt that the service to others and the purity of the self is the way to&nbsp;achieve&nbsp;eternal liberation from this cycle of birth and death, thus renounced their material world. With the strong education background, they redefined the way service is done. Vinayak Lohani - "Parivaar Ashram" - a residential facility for orphans, tribals and the daughters of prostitutes. Madhu Pandit Dasa - "Akshaya Patra" from ISKON Bangalore who feeds one million hungry children every day, in and around bangalore. I met Madhu Pandit Dasa in one of the bloggers meet happened in&nbsp;Bangalore. I am so happy to read his story and felt the connection with him.<br />
<br />
I would say Rashmi Bansal is one of the smartest female in the world, who created herself a chance to interview all those successful people in India. I suspect her next book, would go way beyond India. She would collect the inspiring stories around the world, not just who made it big, but those who made a small difference in a big way. We already have Rashmi Bansal's series competing with "Chicken soup for the soul" series. To make it big, impact millions around the world and to make a real difference beyond the boundary lines, she must go International. But again - No local language please !!!<br />

<b>November 22, 2011</b> : Today, I decided to blog about all the irregularities that I see around me and take action against it. I will keep updating the blog, if anything productive happens after that. Here is the first one with BMTC (Bangalore Metropolitan Transport Corporation).<br />
<br />
I was travelling from Coimbatore to Bangalore on 22-Nov-2011 and got down at Silk Board Bus Stop. I need to catch a local bus from Silk Board to Marathahalli. I generally prefer to travel by Volvo buses only. But there was none at the time. At early morning 5 AM, with such a chill climate, I decided to hop onto the local bus.<br />
<br />
<b>Bus No:</b> D5 (Banashankari to Hebbal)<br />
<b>Boarded On:</b> Silk Board<br />
<b>Got down At:</b> Marathahalli Bridge<br />
<b>Time:</b> 22-Nov-2011 05:19:52 IST<br />
<b>Complaint:</b> Ticket was not given, unless I asked for it.<br />
<br />
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-y2wIKuf62hw/TssA6W4Ll9I/AAAAAAAARRg/SMtC_p-yzfU/s1600/Bus-ticket-D5.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-y2wIKuf62hw/TssA6W4Ll9I/AAAAAAAARRg/SMtC_p-yzfU/s320/Bus-ticket-D5.jpg" width="276" /></a></div>
<br />
The bus was crowded and I was standing near the last row. I asked the conductor, "How much does the ticket cost to Marathahalli?". He said, "10 Rupees". I gave him 10 rupees and was waiting for the ticket. He distributed the tickets to passengers going to other destinations, but not to me. One more guy asked for Marathahalli and he did not get the ticket either. When the conductor was about to move away, I stopped him and asked for ticket. He said, "Give me three more rupees". I looked at him hard and gave him 10 rupees. He scolded me for not giving him exact change, issued the ticket and moved away. The other guy also stopped him and got his ticket.&nbsp;The bus was too crowded, that I did not get into a discussion, but decided to lodge a complaint anyway.<br />
<br />
I just made few assumptions and did a small math. Around 6200 buses run in BMTC alone. Consider that Silk Board to Marathahalli is not even half the trip distance for D5 bus, the conductor already cheated Rs. 20. Assume Rs.10 to average and atleast 10 trips in a day for a bus, the amount that BMTC loses to its conductors is 6200 X 10 X 10 = <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: red;">Rs. 6,20,000/day</span></b> and for an financial year it turns out to be a whopping amount of <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: red;">Rs.22,63,00,000 = Rs. 22&nbsp;crore&nbsp;approx.</span></b><br />
<br />
Yes. I know what you are thinking. Not all the conductors are like that. OK. Also, the amount that I assumed Rs.10 is very less. Lets change the % of fraud conductors and see what happens.<br />
<br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: red;"><b>50% - 11 crore approx.</b></span><br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: red;"><b>25% - 5.5 crore approx.</b></span><br />
<span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: red;"><b>10% - 2.2 crore approx.</b></span><br />
<br />
You might save few bucks&nbsp;travelling&nbsp;without tickets, but see how much BMTC is losing?. Who are they to steal our hard-earned money? We are not talking about the few bucks. We are talking about crores of rupees. With proper&nbsp;re-investments, we can have better infrastructure and may be even reduction in the ticket price. Would you stand with me?<br />
<br />
<b>What to do, if you find any irregularity with the BMTC?.</b><br />
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li>Make sure that you get your ticket first. (whatever the case, not issuing tickets, abusing etc)</li>
<li>Inform him/her that you are going to file an online complaint with BTIS.</li>
<li>If possible, try to capture his/her picture or at least get his/her name.</li>
<li>Please note the Route No and the Bus Registration No.</li>
<li>Go to this link&nbsp;<a href="http://www.btis.in/bus/ticket">http://www.btis.in/bus/ticket</a>&nbsp;and file a complaint.</li>
<li>Make sure that you complaint every time, you come across a situation.</li>
</ol>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;">
<a href="http://www.btis.in/bus/ticket" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;" target="_blank"><img border="0" height="197" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-MCXgx_MML_8/TssPLy9oKCI/AAAAAAAARR0/3U0XBkbBP6Y/s320/BTIS+complaint+page.JPG" width="320" /></a></div>
<b><br /></b>
<b>What could BMTC do to stop the irregularities?.</b><br />
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: normal;">BTIS could give us a compliant number rather than a simple "Thank You". It would be easy to track or to use RTI to get the updates.</span></b></li>
<li>Frequent Ticket Checking on the routes where you receive more complaints would be needed.</li>
<li>If there is a hot-line, the passengers can call and lodge a complaint right from the bus. The Officials can talk to the conductors right on the spot. Because, there is NO proof that can be produced for any of these complaints.</li>
</ol>
There are some positive feedbacks that BTIS actually acts on all the complaints. Lets see what happens !<br />
<br />
<b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: blue;">Question: Have you encountered any such issues with any public transport system?. What did you do?</span></b></div>

<br />
Interesting title. I liked the book design also. Simple but different from the other books. Every chapter begins with a deep orange color page with a bold chapter number on the other side. The book is filled with lots of images, white space to make notes, readable font, good quality paper and it's very nice to hold and read. So, I decided to read the book without even reading a chapter from this book.<br />
<br />
After reading this book, your perception about design would change drastically as it happened to me. Before this book, I thought design is designer's job. Period. But that's not true. Here the author Robert introduces a concept called "<i>Customer experience supply chain</i>". I will let the author explain in his words,<br />
<blockquote class="tr_bq">
Close your eyes and imagine that you are holding an iPod. Now take away iTunes, take away the ability to buy the song for 99 cents without having to pay for the entire CD, lose the ability to create&nbsp;playlist, cut out the packaging, delete the Apple logo and shutter all the aesthetically designed Apple stores. "Is it still an iPod?". No, it's not,&nbsp;because&nbsp;and iPod is an portal to the kaleidoscope of experience.</blockquote>
The physical product or service is the central and most crucial part. But the successful design is about everything that comes in contact with the customers. How the customers feel when they enter your stores or buy your product online, how they feel when they open the package and take out the product, how they feel when they use it, if something goes wrong, what's the experience with the customer service. When you expand your idea of design to everything, then design becomes everyone's job. If you can make people emotionally attached to the experience of buying and using your product, then you have a successful&nbsp;design. You can compare the examples of Motorola Razr and the iPod. Both are brilliantly designed products. But what happened to Razr?. Well. they didn't get the idea of design quite well.<br />
<br />
Lets check what's in this book.<br />
<br />
<b>Design Matters:</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; You get a new idea of "<i>Customer experience supply chain</i>", with lots of real world examples. This definitely changes the way you think about design.<br />
<br />
<b>Do You Matter:</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every CEO should read this chapter (I wish). The author asks a lot of thought provoking questions which would be a real eye opener for many companies. "<i>Why should people bother if you are out of business?. Why do you matter?</i>". Very simple question, but how many companies has an answer to this question. You matter, only if the customers believe that their world will be a darker place with you. How many companies&nbsp;achieved&nbsp;this level of emotional attachment with the customers?.<br />
<br />
<b>How To Matter:</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; Robert explains how to use design to create a relationship with the customer that matters and how the design of products and services creates and emotional connection with the customers. Lots of examples as usual.<br />
<br />
<b>Being Design Driven:</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He again takes the example of Apple and explains how a design driven company like Apple functions and what are all the difficulties that may surface between the design, engineering and&nbsp;manufacturing&nbsp;departments.He gives us a preview of what your company would look like, if you are to change your model to a design driven model.<br />
<br />
Next three chapters "Your Brand Is Not Your Logo", "Products As Portals" and "Your Products And Services Are Talking To People" essentially explains in detail what was discussed in the previous chapters. I feel all these three chapters are redundant and could have been&nbsp;accommodated&nbsp;to other chapters.<br />
<br />
<b>Building A Design Driven Culture:</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; When your company is working on a certain model and if you change it suddenly to an entirely different model, what do you expect?. He explains how the culture of the company should be changed and nurtured by the leadership to excel in design driven model. Remember design is everyone's job. Many companies outsource a whole bunch of their manufacturing, packaging and logistics to different vendors in different countries to reduce the cost. Robert gives suggestions to handle that scenario and again how Apple manages that. He talks a little bit about leadership and also how to hire creative talents and retain them. Basically, if you own a company, this chapter is a must read. Other can ignore this chapter.<br />
<br />
If at all there is one thing that irritated me when I was reading this book, it would be the "Apple Example". The author has beaten the "Apple Example" to death in every chapter and for every concept that he discusses. Just because he is the Director of Industrial Design for Apple?. Well, in that case he could have changed the title to "Why Apple Matters?".<br />
<br />
If you are into Industrial Design or an&nbsp;Entrepreneur or Just curious to know about design or just about Apple, you can read this. For others this book may not be an interesting read.&nbsp;The author's mind is full of&nbsp;usable&nbsp;data, but failed to present it in a non-redundant, interesting manner.<br />

<br />
Could a person be always nonchalant and care-free? That too a boy who was born and brought up in the culture rich India? Well, that’s what Achet is, our hero. I started reading the book with no expectations and an open mind. Rupa &amp; Co’s publishing hiked the credibility even before I started reading. Vikas definitely has a dark sense of humor and a deep philosophical insight.<br />
<br />
The story starts with a guy entering into corporate world afresh and reckless. The very first day he boozes and misses the training. My eyes literally popped out at this! Now, you can imagine what sort of character he could be to do such stuff. To be honest, I can never even imagine doing something like that. While Achet is like this, there is Dev who is an icon of spoiled brat. Then come Arjuna, Alex and Bala. This could be anyone’s story except for few of the eye rolling factors. I was able to connect to every character in some or other way and that made me go deeper into the plot.<br />
<br />
I was very much happy about philosophies sprinkled here and there in the story. It added to the story’s aroma, bringing out even the trivial knots of life. No superficial words and exaggeration made the story almost real and practical. Evasive attitude of the new joiners was well portrayed. Singapore and Kaulalampur was picturized in such a way that I felt they are no way different from any Indian Metropolitan city.<br />
<br />
At some point, I thought, “Am I reading the upgraded version of five-point someone (what not to do at corporate instead of IIT)?” No, this book is definitely not an upgraded version of five-point someone. You might find some traces here and there but this is so different.<br />
<br />
The jokes and pranks of Achet are so pervert. It’s gone overboard when he speaks to those sales people. Is that really necessary? His height of recklessness is shown at various places and makes you raise an eyebrow. Arjuna’s extremism raises many questions in mind. Dev is pathetic but I hardly felt any sympathy for him. Bala was just another girl with no great role in the story.<br />
<br />
The climax is the X factor of the novel and will surely hit your nerves. My heart skipped a beat reading the last few pages. I was so furious and confused at the same time. How many of us can coolly handle the suicide of a friend? That too if it happens in front of our eyes? I leave it to the readers to decide upon that. Many would find the climax as a big cliché. But that is where the story’s beauty lies. It makes the whole novel unique and not a monotonous repetition.<br />
<br />
I found the book very contradicting. It’s so real and surreal at the same time. There are many close-tothe-heart scenes and some dumb scenes too. I really liked the originality of the script and the boldness of the author to write what he actually wanted. Very promising writing and really a commendable work. Might take some time for the story’s depth to descend upon but once it does a strong wave is sure to hit your heart. Many wouldn’t like it at the first read and find it either too philosophical or too fictional. But,I strongly suggest reading this book and later ponder upon the thoughts presented in the book. I can bet that something new would dawn upon you. Great work Vikas! Expecting more books in future!<br />

<br />
Many books on&nbsp;Personal Finance Management gives a lot of tips, tricks &amp;&nbsp;advice&nbsp;to manage our finances well. The main reasons why many people don't follow it through the years are, either the concepts explained are very abstract or it requires a lot of discipline to follow the advice year after year. There are other kinds of books which show you a literally non-existent route to become rich overnight. David Bach differs very much from the others. He shows us<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>The practical proven techniques which will make you rich over the years.</li>
<li>How to make all of them automatic, so that you don't have to test your will power.</li>
<li>You don't need to make a lot of money to become rich. You just need to invest whatever you earn wisely.</li>
</ul>
The best part is that you can read this book in an hour or two and setting up the automated plans may take another couple of hours. That's all David asks from you to make you rich. Interesting?. For me too.&nbsp;The book's title is "Automatic Millionaire". This doesn't mean that, if you follow all the tactics explained in this book, you will become a millionaire. It depends on how early you start saving, how much you are saving and how long you are planning to work. But, the sure thing is that you will be richer when you retire, if you follow the simple concepts explained in this book.<br />
<br />
I will provide a gist of some of the concepts explained in this book. But I would prefer you to read the book by yourself.<br />
<br />
<b>The Latte Factor:&nbsp;</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is for those who live from paycheck to paycheck and have nothing to save. David asks us to track each and every penny spent for a day/week. There will definitely be some dimes, dollars that you can save in little things. Most of us ignore this, because the amount is too small to save. But David shows us, those little amount can grow into huge investments, if invested properly. I think, this is interesting and I started tracking my expenses for a month. Let me see how much I can save.<br />
<br />
<b>Pay Yourself First:</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If you earn a dollar, your govt takes close to 30 cents and you are left with only 70 cents for everything including your savings. He suggests that pre-tax savings are the bound to grow faster than post-tax savings, considering you plan to save the same amount in both the cases. He explains it with the detailed tables and shows us how much we would "lose", if we don't save pre-tax amount. 401(k), 403(B), 457 plans in US are best suited for these kind of savings. In India, we can save 12% in PF, and 88% in VPF and more in PPF. Suggestion from David -&nbsp;If possible, max out the investments that is allowed. I decided to put 88% in VPF.<br />
<br />
<b>Three Rules of Emergency Money:</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; No one can escape from a bad day, unless we are prepared for it.<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Decide how big a cushion you need - David suggests that we need to have three to twenty four month's expenses as reserve money for any unforeseen consequences.</li>
<li>Don't touch it</li>
<li>Put it in the right place - Make sure that your emergency cash earns you interest, when you are not using it. Money markets, Short term govt bonds etc.</li>
</ul>
<b>Debt-Free Home Ownership:</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; "You can get rich renting. Landlords get rich and renters stay poor". Home is the only thing that David suggests you to buy on debt. Some of the reasons are<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Forced Savings</li>
<li>Leverage</li>
<li>Other People's Money</li>
<li>Tax Breaks</li>
<li>Pride of Ownership</li>
<li>Great Investment</li>
</ul>
David gives us elaborate tips to close the loans earlier than the actual tenure. I am gonna use them on my home loan.<br />
<br />
<b>Credit Card Debts:</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Just like Warren Buffet, David suggests us NOT to use credit cards. "<i>Millionaires don't do debt!</i>." Either you have credit card debt or not, you should probably read this chapter as well. He gives us techniques to pay off the debt in a reasonable amount of time, to negotiate with the banks on the interest rates, which credit cards to pay and what are the things to consider when balance&nbsp;transferring&nbsp;the debt. etc., I am going to use these tips with <a href="http://blog.smileprem.com/2011/10/hdfc-bank-we-understand-your-world.html" target="_blank">HDFC Bank</a> on the recent fraud charges on my credit card.<br />
<br />
<b>Tithing:</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Giving back to the Society!. Here he gets philosophical. "The more you give, the more you receive." No scientific evidence, but personal and statistical evidence for tithing. 10% of your income is ideal. More or less depends on your heart. As always, you get tax&nbsp;exemptions&nbsp;on the donations to charity. I won't stress on this factor. I have been tithing for a long time and I don't see any direct correlation to the money that I earn. Or at least, not yet !.<br />
<br />
The beauty is that this book is packed with all the resources that you may need to make all the above automatic, so that you don't miss anything !.<br />
<br />
Thanks David !. For a wonderful book packed with real, practical wisdom.<br />

<b>Book:</b> Wired For Thought: How The Brain Is Shaping The Future Of The Internet<br />
<b>Author:</b> Jeffrey M. Stibel, Erik Calonius, Peter Delgrosso<br />
<b>ISBN:</b> 1422146642<br />
<b>ISBN-13:</b> 9781422146644,978-1422146644<br />
<b>Binding:</b> Hardcover<br />

<br />
Jeffrey Stibel is a brain scientist and entrepreneur, who is the chairman of <a href="http://www.braingate.com/" target="_blank">BrainGate</a>, a brain-implant company that allows people to use their thoughts to control electrical devices and also the president of <a href="http://www.web.com/" target="_blank">web.com</a>&nbsp;which helps&nbsp;entrepreneurs&nbsp;to grow their business in the web. Most importantly, this book is recommended by my all time&nbsp;favorite&nbsp;author <a href="http://www.johnassaraf.com/" target="_blank">John Assaraf</a>. What else you need to read this book?.<br />
<br />
Stibel says that "The Internet is a brain". This is because the Internet (unlike computers) has&nbsp;evolved&nbsp;with many of the basic structures and abilities of the brain. He compares the evolution of human brains over the millions of years with the evolution of the network of computers (i.e. Internet) and concludes that both follow the same pattern. He claims that the network of neurons in our brain is similar to the network of computers in Internet. He doesn't claim that the Internet may become "conscious" in human sense in future. But, it will be capable of creating a collective consciousness.<br />
<br />
This book is divided into four sections with multiple chapters.<br />
<br />
<b>Part I - Building the Brain:</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; From a scientist perspective, he explains the human brain's thinking capability and its limitations. Three most important things to the brain: information storage, processing and communication with other neurons. As of now, the Internet does information storage and communication. Cloud computing does the processing. &nbsp;What would happen, if we upgrade the Internet with Cloud computing?. We can&nbsp;achieve&nbsp;what <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MapReduce" target="_blank">MapReduce</a> did for google.<br />
<br />
<b>Part II - Internet Intelligence:</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The human brain does not calculate all the possible combinations of output for making a decision. It makes decision with little information (Instinct?). Its very good at predicting where the cricket ball will land after a sixer without knowing its velocity, trajectory path etc, rather than predicting the weather next day. To process very little information, you don't need supercomputers. You get the idea?. Also, he talks about "Creative Destruction" in a separate chapter. How neurons lose the connections after maturing into a complete brain is analogous to the way many websites/companies disappear from the web.<br />
<br />
<b>Part III - The Brain behind the Web:</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; He compares the websites to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme" target="_blank">memes</a>. In a chapter, he discusses how the search engines work (primarily google) and the competition between the websites to appear on the first page of the search results is analogous to the Survival of the fittest - Darwinism. He is one of the man behind the algorithm that propels Google's Adsense. He discusses the importance of understanding the language to select the right ads based on the keywords. Very Interesting!.<br />
<br />
Metcalfe's law is discussed in detail and why it did not work. He defines the stages of the Networking as<br />
<ol style="text-align: left;">
<li><b>The Big Bang</b> - The Internet, ant colonies and the brain, all have periods of rapid expansion. Stunting its growth is dangerous at this time.</li>
<li><b>The Collapse</b> - When the network become too big, either it will implode (the brain loses half of its neurons) or its growth will slow rapidly (as with ant colonies). You should allow the network to stabilize.</li>
<li><b>The Equilibrium</b> - Its the stage, where the network oscillates roughly around a certain size. The network is at its peak performance. (like a matured brain)</li>
</ol>
Further, he discusses in detail about the Social Networks and the advantages "facebook" has over the other similar sites. Very interesting to see where the web is going !.<br />
<br />
<b>Part IV - I, Internet:</b><br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; This is the very interesting section of the entire book, which discusses where the Internet is heading to?. Some of the predictions are...<br />
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Internet algorithms will mature and start discarding/penalizing links that are irrelevant, unnatural or fake. (W3C or ICANN?)</li>
<li>Websites will pull information from various sites to create collages of new information, dynamically (a semantic web).</li>
<li>The hyperlinks will evolve to incorporate dynamic weighting based on how many people click or how relevant the link is. (think as a color code, red - best, blue - Good, yellow - OK etc)</li>
<li>The Internet will be able to modify and create Web Sites.</li>
<li>The search engines will evolve into dynamic portals - search for anything and you will be presented with a dynamically created page from contents all over the world. You don't need to go to the specific websites.</li>
<li>Virtual Reality will become an extension of real life or in some cases a replacement. Check out <a href="http://www.habbo.com/" target="_blank">Habbo</a>&nbsp;or <a href="http://secondlife.com/" target="_blank">SecondLife</a>&nbsp;websites. Already millions of people are in virtual worlds spending real money (millions of $$$).</li>
</ul>
When I first started reading this book, I thought Stibel is going to present the SEO concepts in Brain flavour. But, I was wrong. I have a completely new perspective of the Internet. With this information and perspective, we can fine-tune our websites for long time survival in the Web. Many of these things are already happening. Let's jump in and have fun. Thanks to Stibel for a wonderful book.<br />

<br />
Donald J.Trump. Who doesn't know him in the business circle? He is an excellent example of American business success story, who had his hands on real estate, gaming, sports and Entertainment. He is one of the New York Times bestselling author as well. What if Donald Trump goes to the best &amp; brightest business men and women, who run companies ranging from Fortune 500 Corporations to the family-run local businesses and ask them ONLY ONE question.<br />
<br />
"What is the best business advice you ever received?"<br />
<br />
And compiled them into one book? Wouldn't that be a wikipedia of most common of the problems, solutions, strategies, ethics, work culture, leadership, people management etc in business?. Exactly. And, this book has the collective wisdom gained by those who are already in the top. This book will definitely help you NOT to make the same mistakes made by those who traveled ahead of you. If you are an entrepreneur seriously interested to find your way to the top, this book should be in your book-shelf.<br />
<br />
After reading the answers from Presidents, CEOs, CFOs, COOs, MDs, I could sense that their best advice comes from various sources. Majority are from their seniors (in major corporations), from their fathers (in family-run businesses), from their juniors, from their mom in their childhood, from an occasional talk in a party etc. It comes from people from all walks of life. Many leaders hold on to these advices which brought them success. So, along with reading this book, you should listen to people and watch for any lessons that you may get.<br />
<br />
Some of leaders answered in one sentence, some in a paragraph, some listed the advices that guides them and some explains the actual experience from their business life where &amp; how the advice actually helped them. Some of my favorites are here.<br />
<br />
“Put yourself in the customer’s shoes. Sell the medicine as if they would be used by my family, my friends or myself” - George Abercrombie, President and CEO of Roche North American Pharmaceuticals Operations<br />
<br />
“Trust, but verify” – Napoleon Barragan, Chairman and CEO of 1-800-MATTRESS<br />
<br />
“The sun doesn’t shine forever. During an upturn, prepare for the downturn” – Barbara G.Berger, President of Food City markets, Inc.<br />
<br />
“What would be the best thing that could happen from this decision and what would be the worst thing that could happen?. Put your decisions to rigorous analysis” – William C.Byham, Chairman &amp; CEO of Development Dimensions International, Inc.<br />
<br />
“Strive to satisfy the customer. The bottom line will always follow” – Jim Cantalupo, Chairman &amp; CEO of McDonald’s corporation.<br />
<br />
“Five Ps: Prior planning prevents poor performance” – Archie W.Dunham, Chairman of ConocoPhilips.<br />
<br />
“Show me a person smarter than me, I’ll hire them” – Gerald D.Edwards, President &amp; CEO of Engineered Plastic Products, Inc.<br />
<br />
“If you can’t write your strategy or idea on the back of your business card, it’s too complex to execute. Keep it simple” – Dawn Hudson, North America President of Pepsi-Cola, Inc.<br />
<br />
“When you must make a difficult decision, you are not going to be liked or approved of by everyone” – Timothy H.Ling, President &amp; COO of Union Oil of California.<br />
<br />
“The purpose of business is to create value year after year, forever” – Alan Mulally, President &amp; CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes Group.<br />
<br />
“In any given situation, don’t rely on a single solution. Develop a parallel path that could be used in the event that the original solution does not come to bear” – Don Nigbor, Chairman &amp; CEO of Benchmark Electronics, Inc.<br />
<br />
“If they don’t have the authority to say yes, then they don’t have the authority to say no. Deal directly with the decision makers” – Roxanne Quimby, President of Burt’s Bees.<br />
