“As long as you have your eyes on the goal, you don’t see obstacles”. These are the very opening words of the book ‘You can sell’ by Shiv Khera. For a person who is passionate about marketing (of course, me!) this book came as a juicy piece of cake to read and review. What better can I ask for? So, here is the review for the book ‘You can sell’.<br />
<br />
Right in the preface Mr. Khera tells what kind of book this is and for whom it is. I would strongly recommend following his instructions in the preface, for that is the best way to read this book. This isn’t a novel which can be read on the go or taken for light reading just like that. Do not expect to read this book for passing time. Please do have a highlighter and a pen throughout the reading, as there are many points which you might need to highlight for future reference. Pen is for the exercise at the end of every chapter. What a way to reinforce the thoughts in the chapter in the minds of readers! The work book ranges from personal SWOT analysis to a few psychometric tests to explaining the points read in the previous chapter.<br />
<br />
Mr. Khera has artfully structured the book knowing which chapter to place after which chapter. It flows sinuously from one chapter to another without difficulty. No cuts and breaks in between. He has gone to a great detail to mention even the little nuances and discuss about them and their importance. Highlighting of punch lines gets the immediate attention and conveys the message in a nutshell. Adding his personal experiences and who’s ever possible makes the principles look very viable and not impractical to implement.<br />
<br />
Though this is a domain based book, the terms and language used are very simple and even a layman could pick this book and understand what is given. And for those who are in the field of selling or who aspire to be this field, this book shall be a pole star to guide you. Of course, at the end of the day it all zeroes on you. Nobody can induce principles and ideas in you. You are the one who understand, internalize and put those principles and ideas into practice.<br />
<br />
Who is not a salesperson? Anyone who markets himself or his idea or a product or anything for that matter is a salesperson. So, a doctor, a lawyer, an engineer, a politician, a college student and everyone else becomes a salesperson at some point of time. So, you can’t confine this book as a selling practice domain book. It is useful for everyone.&nbsp; Mr. Khera doesn’t feed you with fish for hunger but teaches how to fish.<br />
<br />
These are a few points which I found as the heights of selling insight:</div>
<ul style="text-align: left;">
<li>Leadership is not a popularity contest.</li>
<li>A good professional only learns the trade not tricks.</li>
<li>Selling is nothing but transfer of enthusiasm</li>
<li>Winners compete with themselves; they better their own record constantly</li>
<li>Losers do not like to get up in the morning, winners don’t like to get up in the morning either, but they get up anyways.</li>
<li>When a sales person realizes that the profession is not only about making sales, but involves helping others and solving problems, he becomes a professional.</li>
</ul>
<div>
Though I’m generally not in favor of self-help books there are always exceptions. This book is one such exception. I never found this book manipulative or misleading. It just states the facts and principles for a good salesperson. I would recommend this book to every salesperson and even to those who have taken marketing as a subject in MBA or in any equivalent course.<br />
