A little book with a little story. What's so special in this book, that it sold for more than 26 million copies and still being printed?. I knew this book almost 6 years back. I was not that much into reading back then. But, when I saw this book again in the library after so many years, I felt like the book voluntarily re-appeared in my life for a purpose, may be a message that I need it very badly. Sounds very silly, that too from an atheist. But that's what I felt for true. I started reading to figure out what it has for me.<br />
<br />
The story is simple. There is a maze with cheeses stored somewhere and four characters. Two mice, "Sniff" &amp; "Scurry" and two little men "Hem" and "Haw". All of them starts their day looking for cheese. All four characters are different.<br />
<br />
Sniff - Who sniffs out changes early<br />
Scurry - Who jumps into action no matter what (no hesitation)<br />
Hem - Who denies and resists the change all the time<br />
Haw - Who learns to adapt to the change.<br />
<br />
One fine day, there is no cheese and all four have to venture into the unknown (the maze) to find new cheese. How these four characters react to that change?. End of story. A story as simple as a bedtime story to a kid. The baseline of the story is that "Change" is good in all walks of life. So, enjoy the journey into the unknown (life).<br />
<br />
But, whats so unique in this story is the characterization. We, everyone of us falls into one of these four characters or a mix of these characters in different areas of life. When the story unfolds, we get a lot of inspirational quotes from the author. In one instance, Hem says "<b>I want my <i>own</i></b> <b>Cheese back and I am not going to change, until I get what I want</b>" even when she knows that there is no cheese in store.The one meant for me is this...<br />
<br />
<b><i>The Quicker You Let Go Of Old Cheese, The Sooner You Can Enjoy New Cheese</i></b><br />
<br />
I read out loud those words. Many times in our life, we hold on to some relationships, jobs, situations etc which doesn't make us happy anymore or sometimes doesn't even belong to us. Moving on to the next, adventuring through the unknown territory is what keeps us alive. I learnt to live, today. Thanks to Spencer Johnson for his little book and big wisdom.<br />
<br />
Reading more and more books and reasoning them, teaches me one simple lesson. Every book you read, has a message for you, if you are open to learn them.Many critics tells that this is just a simple story and people are very mad about this. Understand this please, its not the story which changes the readers life, its the individual's interpretation that causes the impact.<br />
<br />
So, read this little book. If you get something out of this, Great. Else, read more books :)<br />

	<span>28 Dec 2010</span> &raquo; <a href="/2010/12/28/the-greatness-guide-robin-sharma-book-review/">The Greatness Guide</a>
<!--        <br/>The Greatness Guide - 101 short essays and stories to inspire you and help you achieve your greatness in all walks of your life. This book is slightly different from his other books. This is a collection of essays and event that happened in Robin's life, written in different periods and at different places, put together in one book for us. I don't know what to mention in the review and what to leave. If I had to write a perfect review for this book, I have to reprint the book's content here. He reiterates the importance of leading without a title in this book as well.<br/> -->

<!--        <br/>The Story Of An Unreasonable Man - from Madhav Mathur is exceptionally fast paced. I liked the writing style. He used a rich vocabulary throughout this book, which I do not expect in a novel. However, you will get used to it in the first few chapters.<br/> -->

<!--        <br/>Finally I found THE BOOK for the programmers. I would call this book 'A Programmer's Bible'. This book has invaluable wisdom accumulated by Paul H. Harkins over 4 decades of his corporate career in programming. Even though it has serious concepts, it reads like a collection of small stories, his experiences, the situations he encountered, his colleagues etc. You wouldn't get bored even in a single chapter. This guy is programming from the dawn of the computers. Mainly into RPG. Most of the java/other technology developers out there can take the message out of this book's examples and apply it to their respective streams.<br/> -->

<!--        <br/>Ryuho Okawa is the founder of "Happy Science" - an organisation or religion which aims to achieve the true happiness, based on the teachings of the author. He claims himself as the spiritual leader, in many places throughout the book. For a while, I was reading only exceptionally good and interesting books, till I come across this one. This book reads like a school text book, which primarily aims at the school children in Japan. But the description of the book in the outer cover was misleading that its for general audience and its mentioned that 20 million copies of his books were sold so far. No questions the numbers anyway, just like me.<br/> -->

He was the part of the team, mediated the 1962 Cuban nuclear missile crisis, which had 99% possibility of becoming a nuclear world war 3 (thanks to Che Guevara - my hero) just to site an example for his credibility.<br/> -->

<!--        <br/>The author Rick Warren wants you to sign a covenant that you will read one chapter a day for the next 40 days to discover the god's purpose for your life. I liked this. Most of the time, when we read a big book full of wisdom and knowledge, we tend to skim over few pages/chapters and at the end of the book, very few messages stay on. But, if you read one chapter at a time and think about it the whole day, you GET the message. Rick is brilliant.<br/> -->

She became so, with her best selling book & DVD, "The Secret". She comes with a sequel "The Power", which is expected to sell atleast 20 million copies, out of which 2 million copies are printed and almost sold out. So, whats in this book?.

<!--        <br/>Its a story about a young dolphin, Daniel Alexander Dolphin - who has a dream. A dream to ride the perfect wave in the sea. As soon as I read the first few pages, I couldn't help myself - not to think about Jonathan Livingston Seagull. I felt that this dolphin is the same story told with a different character.<br/> -->
